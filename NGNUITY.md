### Introduction

The NGnuity: Renaissance aims to create an ecosystem of open source software and blueprints for modular, repairable, patent-free and reverse-engineered technologies that will enable a moneyless and post-scarcity economy to come about.

### What is Post-scarcity?

Think the Venus Project or the Zeitgeist Movement. Some also like to call it Fully Automated Luxury Communism. Yet Marxist schools of thought tend to be in favour of an exclusively worker-controlled economy. You're a human, not a worker. In a post-scarcity economy, people will be free to choose whether or not they wish to be workers (the bee), or idlers (the cat).

Who controls a post-scarcity economy, if not the workers? The collective does, of course - yet it is extremely important not to rely on the word [Worker], as this would imply that someone living in a post-scarcity economy can be anything but.

A post-scarcity economy is entirely resource-based. The blueprints for the full automation of the means of production are freely accessible to anyone; as long as you have land and raw materials, everything else will be free.

During the Chinese Great Leap Forward (1958-1962), Mao Zedong proposed the idea of the Backyard Steel Furnace. Peasants would build themselves improvised, homemade steel furnaces in their backyards so as to boost steel production for the country. Documentaries on steel-making were distributed to people in order to fill in the gaps in their knowledge.

Why did the Backyard Steel Furnace fail? And why did the Great Leap Forward fail? It failed because it takes years to build the skills and expertise needed to master a particular craft. It was also unscientific, as the Maoist movement tended to be anti-intellectual in some aspects; similar to how Southern, rust-belt, rural Americans dismiss the voices of the scientific community and experts they deem to be condescending and elitist.

Machines, on the other hand, do not have this problem. If everybody owned a 3d printer, built according to the same set of parts and the same set of instructions, as well as the same .stl files - they would all produce nearly identical items.

Yet at the end of the day, we still need raw energy. Unlike data and knowledge, which can be copied ad infinitum - raw energy (e.g. the air that you breathe, the land that you live on, the fresh water you drink) will always be scarce until the heat death of the Universe - which is why it should be regulated and distributed by a central authority to ensure everyone gets a fair share. Period.

### What is Accelerationism?

Accelerationism is often used interchangably with Terrorism these days; deliberately causing chaos and destruction, in order to make it easier to fill the void of power and overthrow a government.

This isn't what Accelerationism means in literature. Left-wing accelerationism typically seeks to encourage and expedite automation, technological progress and 'ride the wave of Capitalist economic growth' all the way to an egalitarian, technology-fueled Utopia.

Some people view this as irresponsible and destructive. In their view, automation is more likely to bring about a dystopian future and exacerbate inequality, rather than emancipate us from it.

The truth, I believe, lies somewhere in the middle. Automation will only bring about a better world if we actively partake in its development ourselves. As long as [we] write the code. As long as [we] build the machines.

Otherwise, yes - we will end up with a Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Facebook one-world-government.

### A New Philosophy of Automation

- The simplest approach to automation is the best approach. e.g. Which is better - A cat door, or an automatic door opener with a built-in camera and computer vision?
- Prioritize owning tools that can be used to build as many other tools as possible. e.g. A cordless drill has greater utility than a box full of screw drivers. A 3d printer has more utility than a paper printer. A desktop computer has more utility than a Television. etc. You can't build everything at home, but if you have a good enough metal, glass and fabric 3d printer, you can easily print yourself the tools needed to make almost everything else.  
- Automation must never be used to maximize profits, but to reduce working hours and the cost of goods and services for society as a whole.
- Automation must be encouraged and accelerated in order to bring about a post-scarcity economy and work-free society as soon as possible. Either through government policy, or by taking matters into our own hands through 3d printing, CNC machinery (Computer Numerical Control) and file sharing i.e. Digital Mutual Aid. Every second that isn't spent making your work as efficient as possible is a second wasted.
- Automation must not come at the cost of human fitness. E.g. Using a mobility scooter instead of walking when you are not disabled. We must build a thriving culture centered around the pursuit of physical fitness and aesthetics, as well as the arts, crafts, scientific innovation and creative endeavours.
- Automation must be used to regain our humanity, not to dehumanize us. We were hunter-gatherers before we became agricultural drones. We shall use our free time to explore the stars, conquer distant solar systems, find alien life, etc.
- We define Work as: Any labour which you are forced to perform against your will in order to keep society operating. People shouldn't have to Work if they don't want to. Period.
- To put it simply: Let machines be the agricultural drones that we were forced to become in order to build early human civilization, so that we can once again become Hunter-gatherers.
- This is why classical Marxism is incompatible with our movement. Classical Marxists are Agricultural Drones. We seek to live like technologically savvy Hunter Gatherers, and to build socialism on our own terms.
- Build a new society around the same values and principles as the Linux operating system.

### A Best Case Scenario for a Technological Singularity

If you've ever looked up `how to brew your own Beer` or `grow your own food` on YouTube, then you've already had a glimpse of what a post-scarcity economy will be like.

Artificial Intelligence, peer-to-peer file sharing and blockchain (non cryptocurrency) technology will be able to fulfill the vast majority of our needs and answer most of our questions at the click of a button. Every household will be able to own their own NGnuity 3D Printer Robot Arm that is able to print not just plastic, but also fabric, glass and metal using inverse kinematics, as well as selective powder deposition technology plus a small furnace (coming soon this year).

This robotic arm prototype will be fully self-replicating, modular, easily repairable and open sourced (search `SCARA Robot Arm` if you want a good example). Patents and copyrights are abolished and strictly forbidden.

YouTube videos, tutorials, wikis and documentation will be widely accessible. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (e.g. GPT-NEO) will automate the process of designing 3d models and gcode for all of these applications, so that people don't have to be proficient in CAD to be able to use them. The more data is shared, the more data is generated.

Eventually - you'll be able to learn how to Learn using online tutorials. And then learn how to learn how to learn how to learn using online tutorials. And then AI will also be able to learn how to learn how to learn how to do stuff by bulk-watching videos and data-harvesting, too; optimizing the optimizers.

Until technological progress becomes unstoppable and grows at such a fast and exponential rate that you end up with God-like superpowers at your fingertips; capable of curing cancer, extending your lifespan and building your own nuclear fusion reactor in your garage if you want to. Power: Overwhelming!

Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you.

### Creating an effective Antidote to Big Tech

The Big Tech motto is: You will own Nothing, and you will be Happy. Our motto is: You will be able to own Everything you can possible imagine, and it'll be up to you to use that power responsibly.

Some people believe that mainstream 3D printing (especially metal 3d printing) is going to become too dangerous if left unregulated, as anybody will be able to print themselves e.g. a firearm, if they wanted to.

We think this is a good thing. That which isn't dangerous, is useless. 3D printing shouldn't be an expensive toy that bored silicon valley hipsters play around with in their spare time. In order for it to truly transform the world, it [absolutely has to] dare to be dangerous.

It should become so dangerous that anybody could build themselves an ICBM in their garage and shoot down the international space station, if they wanted to. Or land a small rover on the moon and kickstart an era of DIY space exploration.

### Creating a viable alternative to Communism and PieInTheSkyism

What do I think of other Marxists? Better yet - what do I think about the Venus project? We pretty much want the same things, and would be happy to work together given the opportunity.

The key difference is that the NGnuity: Renaissance seeks to start work on expediting the Singularity [immediately] and with no excuse. We're more focused on practicality; taking advantage of the tools that we have right now at our disposal in order to lay down the building blocks for a post-scarcity civilization.

I should also point out that the NGnuity: Renaissance is not a pacifist movement. If global wealth inequality ever got to a point where we had God-like, biologically-immortal, space-faring trillionaires walking the Earth and continuing to enrich themselves at the expense of the homeless, jobless, weak and frail, then we will have no choice but to fight and destroy them. This isn't Bernie 2016 or Occupy Wallstreet.

We are not pacifists, and never will be. The time for peaceful revolution is long gone. Period. If the Venus project has a problem with that, then they need to go away.

### Creating Believable Alternatives to Nihilism

Meme culture, problematic fandoms, celebrity worship, dogecoin, NFTs, the Metaverse and rampant consumerism are all by-products of the global decline in religious belief. As Nietzsche famously put: "God is Dead".

The NGnuity Renaissance doesn't aim to create another void for people to fill. Rather - it's only here to provide the tools necessary to survive the crises of Late Capitalism and at best, offer some sort of perspective that should help you make sense of the chaotic mess of an age that we live in.

None of that is to say that we should embrace the abyss and wander around aimlessly in life. You should ideally aim to create your own meaning and become your own God; creator of worlds, as opposed to a destroyer.

One should also strive to understand the nature of other ideas and why they exist in the first place. What makes someone say Save the Dolphins? What makes others say Kill the Dolphins? What do we do about it? Do we compromise, or do we pick a side? Are all ideas equally true, or can there only be One Truth?

If you believe that all ideas are equally true, then you are a nihilist. Democracy itself could thus be thought of as a nihilistic political system; rather than writing policies based on a strict set of moral values and truths which are held to be self-evident, they are written based on the median sum of all opinions. Which radically fluctuate over time.

So how are we supposed to accomodate the group that wants to kill all Muslims? Or the group that wants to bring back Slavery? Or the group that wants to legally burn kittens alive for fun?

That's the thing - You don't. You force them to change, or you fight them. The path of Combat is the path of Life.

It is the neverending struggle for justice and a better world that gives meaning to our lives. Not the acceptance of what is considered 'Good Enough'. Not the acceptance of what is 'comfortable'.

### Only a Unifying Moral Framework can Bring the Left Together

The reason we often see so much division among 'The Left' is because people don't have a clue about what they actually want.

Some people want 'Freedom'. Others want 'Tax-funded Healthcare and Education'. Yet 'Tax-funded Healthcare and Education' is considered anti-thetical to 'Freedom' for some people. (I will talk more about Freedom™ later in this book).

Some people say that Marxism is authoritarian. Others say that it advocates for a stateless society. Some people say that we can only have nice things with a stronger government. Others say that government and centralization itself is the problem.

What the left is ultimately lacking is a unifying moral framework. Most people on the left are actually Utilitarians. Utilitarianism is the fundamental belief that your actions can only be weighed and assesed as 'Good' based on whether or not they'll [maximize well-being] and/or [minimize suffering] [for people as a whole].

Right-wingers, on the other hand, tend to be more concerned with actions that maximize well-being and minimize suffering [for themselves].

### Weaponizing Hustle Culture to the detriment of Capitalism

We should view Work as a means to an end, not as a virtue in and of itself. Our true virtue should be to live a happy life free from disease and hardship, and allow everybody else to achieve the same.

However, in order to get there, we have to work tirelessly - and [ruthlessly]. The emancipatory potential of technology is not going to unlock itself on its own. There are real and tangible rewards waiting for us at the end of the battlefield, after all, but only if we take control of the steering wheel ourselves.

As much as I consider myself a supporter of the Anti-work movement, I also have to accept that movements cannot succeed without a coherent ideology, and certainly not without a clear strategy and path forward.

There is a tendency among Millennials and Gen Z to label themselves as Anarchists, Nihilists and 'non-political' pacifists who just want 'Freedom'. But 'Freedom' is useless as a word. The word you're actually looking for is [Power].

Try swapping the word 'Freedom' with the word 'Power' in any given piece of writing, and you'll notice that it'll still make perfect sense. e.g. The 'Freedom' to own slaves, could just as well be Tyranny from the point of view of the slave being owned. It's deceitful and disgusting.

It would be far more honest for prospective Slave owners to admit that they want the [Power] to own slaves. And for the slaves to admit that they want the [Power] to live their lives as they wish.

I would even go as far as to call for the removal of the word Freedom from the English dictionary. Speaking in terms of personal Em[power]ment and political [Power] dynamics would be far more useful.

We live in a world where Might makes Right. If you don't want to be conquered, you need to be capable of conquering. Strength is the only thing that matters in this world. You can deny this all you want, but it's the ugly and eternal truth.

Being incoherent and impartial only makes it easy for you to be conquered by those who are strong, coherent, disciplined and focused. History is written by the victors, after all. You can't overthrow your rulers if you're not willing, let alone capable, of ruling and governing yourself.

You also cannot afford to look weak. Not saying you need to be a supermodel, but one ought to try to put as much effort into one's appearance as possible. We live in an age that almost exclusively experiences their objective reality through screens and public social media personas.

Just a few days ago, there was an interview on Fox News with Jesse Watters, and Doreen: a transgender woman and Reddit moderator who claimed to be a representative of the anti-work movement. She technically didn't say anything that hadn't already been discussed ad nauseam on the subreddit, but was nonetheless judged for having a sloppy appearance, as well as a 'manly' voice. In short - she was criticized for being Weak and Frail, by a subreddit that claims to stand up for the weak and frail.

Another criticism levied against Doreen was that she is a dog walker who works no more than 20 hours a week, and therefore doesn't have a right to represent the movement. Wasn't she at least practicing what she preaches? Why should the spokesperson for a movement that names itself Anti-Work [have to be] a self-crucifying and burned out workaholic? Weren't these people opposed to the Protestant work ethic?

Doesn't make any sense, right? Well, if you go back and read what I've just explained: 1. that Might Makes Right, 2. that history is written by the Victors, and 3. that nobody respects the Weak and Frail, even the Weak and Frail themselves - you'll begin to understand why she got the criticism that she received.

### Might makes Right is not a statement of Morality

It's not a statement of Morality - it is a statement of Fact. Before we exercise morality, we first need to accept the reality, and work around it - as opposed to working against it.

Clean your room. Tidy your hair. Get your voice in order. Shower. Exercise. If you are trans - then look like the gender you identify as, or die trying. Work non-stop (to expedite the Singularity). Don't be pathetic. If you have a disability or a mental health problem - then get over it, or die trying. If you're obese, lose weight. You don't have a choice. It's either that, or we lose the war. War doesn't forgive the weak and disabled. Get over your autism. Get over your depression.

Does any of this make you angry? Of course it will, but it should. Revolutionary movements cannot succeed without great strength and sacrifice. Suffer now, so that you can enjoy a better tomorrow.

Once we get ahold of the technology that will allow us to enhance our minds and bodies and be rid of our weaknesses, we will never have to worry about any of this again. But until we get there - this is how we have to roll.

Make it your mission in life to attain power - so that you can use that power to bring about the positive change that you wish to see in the world.

Strength and power can take on many forms. Beauty is power. Money is power. Discipline and sickening work ethic is power. Physical strength is power. The ability to network and make a lot of friends is power. Having a sense of humor is power. Being able to play a musical instrument is strength and power. Being able to organize and mobilize a large mob of ordinary people toward a single goal, is power and strength in numbers.

My point still stands; strength is the only thing that matters in this world. Everything else, is just a delusion for the weak. In order to free the slaves, one must become the master. And then it'll be up to you to become the better master, or be corrupted by greed.

The world needs strongmen; at least, in order to keep the other strongmen at bay, and for as long as they still exist.

Anarchists will always fail. r/WorkReform will fail, too. Thomas Hobbes was right. Machiavelli was right. Read 'The Prince' - it will only make you more effective as a leftist.

### Technology is not the Enemy. Supply Chains are

If I wanted to build myself a chair - I would go for a walk into the woods, chop some wood with a home-made axe, chisel out some clever joints - and build myself a chair. No nails required.

If I wanted to grow some food - I could plant a few seeds, keep a pile of compost, keep an eye out for pests and disease - and then harvest the fruits of my labour.

If I wanted to build myself just a handful of semiconductors - I would need an entire laboratory full of expensive equipment. See where this is going?

At the very core of the NGnuity: Renaissance is the idea that [every] human being should have access to the tools and the knowledge necessary to source everything they could possibly need for their own well-being and survival. Including medicine. Including semi-conductors. Including a simulation of human company. Etc.

Why not just abandon technology altogether? Because the primitivist, baboon-hunting lifestyle would only work for a small population of people, and also assumes that you don't have health conditions that require medication and pharmaceuticals in order to correct.

It almost certainly wouldn't be a practical way to live on a planet of 8 billion people. Without farming and agriculture, wild prey would be driven to extinction almost overnight. Feces, urine and unsanitary conditions would accumulate globally from lack of plumbing and waste water management.

Primitivists are stupid and it's perfectly fine to call them that. They usually reply to the above arguments by making exception after exception, as well as excuses - revealing the holes in their ideology as they babble on.

The only real valid point they have is that modernity does not satisfy our innate desires for curiosity, exploration and play. Society and civilization is a non-stop process of self-domestication and suppression of natural instincts. Nobody comes out of the womb ready to grow crops and work at an office to enrich corporations - that takes years of training and conditioning.

A human being who comes fresh out of the womb is practically an ape. It is the repeated training, conditioning and scooby-snacks that society and civilization instill upon them that turns them into 'modern men'.

Civilization is a separate organism in and of itself. 'The Machine', if you will. It even evolves and mutates over time, just like living creatures - assimilating herds of minions as it expands.

But that's not the fault of technology and civilization per se. The real problem is the 'bad' use of technology, as well as bad political systems. Capitalism is the problem - Period.

Reform has already been tried. Communism has already been tried. It doesn't work. Early 21st century culture seems to have an obsession with nostalgia, revival and 'reboots' - something that seems to permeate not just the entertainment industry, but even politics itself.

Stop it. We need new ideas.

### Liberal Democracy is beset by an inability to generate Radical Change

It was already hard enough to fight for revolution and reform when half a country consisted of hardened Gangsters who built skyscrapers without safety gear and hauled illegal liquor for a living.

The average Millennial and Gen Z will never have the military training and discipline required to overthrow a government and install a new one.

As a 29 year old Millennial (Zoom-llennial?) myself, I certainly don't exclude myself from this category. And even if you think you're strong, smart and competent enough by your own standards - there's always somebody out there ready to burst your bubble and kick your butt. It's better just to assume that you suck at everything, and then work toward non-stop improvement, than it is to assume that you're good enough as you are. That way you won't need to rely on external feedback in order to measure your progress.

It's always better to have a Negativity Bias in regards to your own capabilities, though it must also be combined with the restless pursuit of success at all costs - because Negativity Biases can be discouraging and de-motivating. It's a very difficult thing to do, but not impossible. Mind over matter.

Our feeble minds are heavily addicted to social validation and encouragement from our peers and ingroup in order to get the motivation and inspiration to accomplish what we want. Again - this is bad.

I recommend adopting the same '#hustle' type of mentality that the Capitalists espouse - and then apply that same amount of fanatical work ethic in order to build post-scarcity Socialism and destroy the old system forever.

But like I said - all hope is not lost. We are a tech savvy generation - we can use technology to get what we want. Anybody can teach themselves computing, programming, robotics and cybersecurity from home. That's how modern warfare works now. Let's double down on that strength as we work on correcting our weaknesses.

### Fake news, Parallel Realities and Social Entropy

As I had explained in previous paragraphs: today's world is marked by extreme political division, social media propaganda and a huge range of variations in public opinion. Outlandish beliefs. Bizarre fandoms. Echo chambers. Fake news. Chaos. Randomness. Social entropy.

Is this merely the by-product of the internet age, giving everybody a microphone and a platform to express their biases, views and niches? Quite possibly, but it doesn't paint the whole picture.

Liberalism, post-modernism and nihilism are the cause of the problem. People who don't believe in anything, will almost invariably fall for anything. Neo-Nazis thrive in post-modern, liberal, nihilistic environments, after all.

That's because, as I've explained before: if everything that we've taken for granted is now subject to question, if all of history is now subject to revision, and if all morality is now self-important, righteous and irrelevant - then even the most evil and awful beliefs could be reframed as being acceptable, too.

Question everything a little bit, and you might just become a smarter and more interesting person.
Question everything too much - and you'll end up justifying Nazism and Pedophilia.

Understanding the nature of internet rabbit holes and echo-chambers is also helpful. How do some people arrive at Flat-earth beliefs, while others arrive at Homo-fascism and Anarcho-Primitivism? The internet, of course.

That's not to say that everything on the internet is fake news and garbage - only that you should maintain a sense of self-awareness on your quest to exploring new ideas. Be aware of how rabbit holes could potentially make you lose touch with reality.

Had you not ended up a flat-Earther, you may have ended up a New Age mystic selling crystals and herbal supplements online, depending on which set of websites were recommended to you first. Again, this isn't a condemnation of open-mindedness. Only a plea for self-awareness, so that we can break out of the predictable patterns that keep us from becoming the most powerful version of ourselves.

### Tankies, Trumpers, Celebrity Worship and Simping

What is a Tankie? Tankies are left-leaning people, usually Westerners, whose 'activism' and praxis is almost exclusively limited to: cheering for authoritarian regimes that have very little to do with Socialism (e.g. Rodrigo Duterte, Vladimir Putin, Bashar Al Assad, etc.) or showing nostalgic admiration for Soviet-era regimes that have long ceased to exist and are no longer relevant to our modern digital age (e.g. USSR, Maoist China, etc.).

Why are Tankies ineffective as leftists? Because none of these regimes offer anything useful to the present day realities of the leftist cause, aside from fueling anti-Western propaganda (which is usually weaponized and co-opted by right-wingers and conservatives, anyway).

Why do people become Tankies? Because they're weak and powerless, and they can be forgiven for that. We as leftists should always stand up for the weak and powerless.

In short - Tankyism is on the rise because Liberal Democracy is beset by an inability to generate Radical Change. That's it.

Simping for billionaires, oligarchs and authoritarians is not going to change anything. But I suppose it could provide a temporary form of delusional Escapism for some people.

"Fine. I don't want to be a Tankie. I don't want to be a Trump supporter. What should I be, instead? I'm still angry and want radical change in my life!"

What you should be doing is creating your own Revolutionary movements. Appointing your own strong and charismatic leaders. And then matching the success of the emancipatory movements of the past, as opposed to nostalgically worshipping them for the rest of eternity, in hopes that they'll rise from the dead.

Worship the future - not the Past. Create your own movements that reflect what you truly believe in - don't piggy back off of someone else's.

Piggy-backing off of other movements means you'll forever be at the mercy of their flaws and imperfections. Was the USSR homophobic? Did Mao really kill 20 million people? Is Putin a socialist, or a fascist? Is present-day China capitalist, or socialist? Should I give my critical support to Xi Jinping?

See, none of these things would matter if you just created a new movement from scratch, and let go of the past. Yes, you will struggle to find followers and supporters at first. Yes, people these days are incredibly weak and uncreative. Yes, you will feel immature and self-important. But at least you'll have a clean conscience. And you won't have to worry about whether or not your ideology can accomodate gays, lesbians and trans people - because, it'll be [your] movement.

This doesn't just apply to tankies. It apples to everything from problematic fandoms such as furries, bronies and weebs, all the way to Donald Trump and Elon Musk supporters.

For God's sakes - stop simping! Stop copying someone else's homework. Stop putting your hopes on rich people to solve your problems for you. Do [You].

### We Work to pay Rent. Not to purchase Goods and Services

In the first few paragraphs, I had talked about how a post-scarcity economy will make all goods and services virtually free, except for natural resources.

This is especially true when it comes to Land ownership. Land ownership is virtually impossible to provide in abundance, short of building skyscrapers and floating cities everywhere. Land ownership is thus the one and only thing that should strictly regulated and fairly distrubuted among the people.

We work to pay rent to a landlord, more than we work to collect a paycheck. Money is usually thought of as a unit measuring time and effort spent on a particular product. Compensation of labor. This isn't the case when it comes to the extraction of rents.

When it comes to land ownership, rental properties and real estate - the early bird gets the worm. The rent that you pay to a landlord, is not a reflection of the effort that said landlord has put into their property. It is slavery and exploitation. Period.

The 2020s in particular is an era that is marked by the Fear of Missing Out. Hoaring of hard assets; precious metals, cryptocurrency, real estate. Even the hoarding of toilet paper and food.

Our present-day economy no longer rewards those who work hard - only those who get the worm early. The rest will be renters. Slaves to scalpers, scammers and landlords. So much glory - so much Freedom™!

### Real Reason why we Hate to go to Work

Why do we hate Work so much? It used to be that we could work a day job, come home to a husband/wife and kids, save up for a house, be happy, etc. Talk trash and laugh with your co-workers. Catch up with them for a beer on Friday and Saturday nights at the pub. Go to the cinema once in a blue moon. Take the kids to soccer practice. And so on.

We no longer live in this world. Not even close. Anybody who tells you otherwise is delusional.

Birth rates are plummetting, costs of living keep rising, costs of housing keep rising. People sit on their phones at lunch break instead of talking to each other. Co-workers hate each other. Asking someone out for a coffee in your workplace is now Sexual Harrassment.

Bosses were always jackasses, but having those nice little moments inbetween are what made work Tolerable. We no longer have any of those nice moments at work - it's all just grim, existential Endurance at this point. The average person works just to come home and eat themselves into a coma while watching Netflix and scrolling social media. No purpose, no soul, no humanity.

The modern workplace has become an extremely toxic environment, and quite frankly, there is no going back. You can dream on all you want about your nostalgic revival of the Glory days. They're not coming back.

What lies ahead is a very decadent and dystopian landscape, and you know it. Death would be preferable than working under such a system. Unless you prepare for it, it's going to hit you like a train in a way that you will never recover from. I'd rather be prepared than naive.

### Weaknesses and Strengths of the Antiwork movement

Let's face it - you're going to be ridiculed for being Anti-work, which is why it is important to build emotional and economic self-reliance. Not [just] economic self-reliance. Having a robot companion to compensate for extended periods of solitude and alienation would be an advantage.

It's still better than continuing to feed a decadent, filthy, collapsing dystopia. Stop caring what people think. In fact - just delete social media, and learn to walk alone for a while.

People seem to have more respect for those who commit suicide than those who simply drop out of the system. Those people are so reliant on validation from the system - they will fight to their deaths in order to defend it. The Protestant work ethic continues to haunt even the most ardent and fantatical leftists to this day.

We've already seen it with the downfall of the r/Antiwork movement. They seemed to almost be [ashamed] of the things they believe in, to the point of actively watering down everything that comes out of their mouths.

Frankly - the only thing worth dying for would be to put an end to this nightmare. Better dead than 'Red'. Better dead than Blue, for the matter.

That's actually the beauty of this movement. It doesn't need the whole world to be on board in order to succeed. If we could just get one person to build themselves a fully automated, economically self-sufficient homestead - we've won the war.

### A Call to Never Surrender. A Call to Anti-Capitalist Jihad

"It's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of Capitalism" - according to the Slavoj Zizek and Mark Fisher circles.

It would in fact be better for the world to burn to the ground if Capitalism gets its way. There's two paths you can take in the face of political hopelessness: either become a Doomsday Prepper, a homesteader, an isolationist - or just stop having kids and pour gasoline all over the flame; letting go of the steering wheel and allowing civilization to collapse from population decline, riots, rampant crime and climate catastrophe.

If you're going to go the Doomsday Prepper route, make sure you stock up on a lion's share of computer chips, preferably with AI and deep learning capability. You're not going to repopulate the world without resorting to inbreeding. You need at least 500 people to do so successfully. Otherwise, good luck practicing incest and potentially giving birth to children with genetic disabilities, further putting strain on your tiny bunker colony.

Be sure you preserve your own DNA. Build a General Artificial Intelligence able to safeguard it; so as to ensure that the human species can be engineered back from extinction with the help of artificial wombs, genetic engineering and in vitro gametogenesis.

The babies will wake up to a world ruled by machines, and  will subsequently be raised by humanoid androids, too. But the human race will at least be saved from extinction.

Doesn't this contradict the premise of this chapter? Of course it does. It's basically satire.

The only answer is to never stop fighting. Go out with a bang. Drag your enemy down with you to the pits of hell if need be.

The only answer is anti-capitalist Jihad.

### 3D Printing allows for Worker cooperatives and Socialist movements to be built entirely online

That's exactly right.

Thanks to open source 3d modeling software and the Internet - we can put in the work to create .stl models for tools, gadgets and works of art. Which we can then give away and distrubute across the entire the globe free of charge.

It is an unfortunate paradox: organizing socialist movements offline is especially difficult for the people who would most benefit from socialism. e.g. People who are disabled, or those who live in remote and rural areas with no means of transportation.

We can't keep handicapping ourselves like this. It took nearly 11 years of Occupy Wallstreet, Bernie 2016 and Black Lives Matter riots just to get 1 Amazon warehouse to be unionized in the U.S. We need exponential progress. We need [dangerous] movements.

Embrace technology.

### On Artificial Intelligence-Run Governments

Should Artificial Intelligence be in charge of all policy-making? Of course, but that depends on who is responsbile for training the neural networks and/or writing the code.

Human beings are generally good at figuring out what the right way to behave is and what good rules should be, but they're not good at consistently applying those rules, let alone practising what they preach in the long term.

Take Christianity for instance. 'Love thy neighbour'. '...sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven!' These are overall good rules, but they were not applied consistently as time went by.

Over the centuries, Christianity became a complete abomination and bastardization of what it used to be. Why? Because the human brain is an [analog] computer. Human beings are capable of taking any given piece of writing - even that which is written clearly, explicitly and literally - and twisting the meaning of it to suit their own self-interest.

Analog computers don't follow strict sets of rules and logic gates. One advantage to this is that it allows for flexibility, crativity and the avoidance of predictable patterns of behavior. But it also means that good rules will be broken; for the better, or for the absolute worst.

Digital computers, however, are just as capable of creativity as analog computers, if not more. e.g. DALL-E, GPT-3, GPT-NEO (open source), etc.

When computers make mistakes, it's invariably due to bad programming. Sometimes a space ray will hit the Earth in just the right manner so as to cause random bits to flip on a machine, but such events are extremely rare. 99.9999% of the time - a digital computer is doing exactly what it is told to do.

If you go to the bank and deposit 5x $20 dollar notes, you will always see $100 in your bank balance. (Actually, this is a bad example, as ATMs are notorious for being pathetic and dysfunctional due to how expensive and inconvenient it is for banks to upgrade their damn software to something newer than Windows XP. They still can't even get rid of payment processing delays. Airlines are just as bad! Go figure.)

Bureaucratic garbage aside, my point stands. If you use a calculator, you will always get 50+50=100, 1+1=2, etc. You will always get out of AI, exactly what you put in. So it's not a matter of whether or not Artificial Intelligence itself is evil, but whether or not you can come up with a decent and stable iteration of it to start with.

However, if your goal is to have a society that will [never] change its core values (e.g. the maximization of happiness, maximization of human potential, minimization of suffering) - and [never] become corrupted, no matter how many centuries go by - then having an AI government is clearly worth the effort to pursue.

### On Animal Rights and Veganism

In previous chapters I'd talked about Post-Scarcity, Accelerationism and Utilitarianism.

To sum it up: the NGnuity: Renaissance follows the ideology of Utilitarianism, using tactics of Accelerationism, in order to bring about a Post-Scarcity economic system.

Utilitarianism factors in the happiness and wellbeing of all sentient life, not just human beings. So even the emancipation of animals should be considered a long-term goal for us.

Opponents to this idea argue that the natural world operates under natural law. So because bears, lions and predators eat other animals, there is no need to apply any sort of morality to the rest of the non-human animal kingdom whatsoever.

Once again: We are haunted by the reality of 'Might makes Right'. The strongest organism gets to impose their will on the weaker ones, because [they can], etc.

Human beings have the luxury of [being able to choose] whether or not they want to eat meat. Soon we will even have the luxury of being able to eat meat without the need to slaughter a living creature to begin with, thanks to advances in biotechnology; in vitro cultures of stem cells harvested from the muscle tissue of pigs, cows and chickens.

A Kardashev Type I civilization (one that has complete power and mastery over every single source of energy of its home planet) will even be able to re-engineer the world's ecosystem to its liking. Earthquakes and hurricanes would become a thing of the past. Lions and hyenas would be fed lab-grown meat in national parks and nature reserves. The spread of new diseases and parasites will be curtailed before they even have the chance to infect a single organism.

So yes - Even [predation itself] can eventually be abolished. Even the horrors of the natural world can one day be confined to the dustbin of history, while still respecting the overall beauty and integrity of natural landscapes.

As a utilitarian one must, however, prioritize that which one has the most amount of power and control over.

Before we can abolish predation, we need to abolish animal slaughter. Before we can abolish animal slaughter, we need to abolish factory farming. Before we can abolish factory farming, we need to abolish wage slavery and human trafficking, etc.

What this means is that 500 years from now, we will still have a very clear roadmap for Revolution and emancipation from oppression and needless suffering!

There will [never] be a time when we can just throw our arms up in the air and indulge in hedonistic decadence. [Even nearby galaxies, star systems and parallel universes] must eventually be liberated from the oppressive forces of Natural Law.

This leaves no room for nihilism. Rather, it answers the most fundamental question: What is the Meaning of Life?

Life is a game of Power. A neverending battle to assert your own needs, wants and desires against external forces pushing back against you, putting you back in your place. Forcing you back into the void where you came from.

The purpose of life is to acquire Power. To become master of the cosmos. To become the strongest and most powerful organism in your own bubble of space and time. To gain the wisdom, the skills and the knowledge that will enable you to succesfully tweak every single atom in the cosmos to your own liking and preferences. And to empower all other living creatures around you to share the same experience of living and loving at maximum capacity.

And if you can't make it, you die trying. Don't go gentle into that good night. Rage against the dying of the light.

### How to contribute

No money is needed. Only data, knowledge and information. Simply give away as much free data and knowledge as possible on any of the sites and repositories that are linked to the NGnuity: Renaissance (such as Ngnoid TV or Ngnoid 3d). Preferably anything that is obscure and hard to find, but of good quality and in good faith nonetheless.

Aside from giving away data (in a way that you will actually benefit from) - you can also become a developer at any of our repositories. Fork your own copy of anything you want and give it a shot.

Money is not a good way to contribute - because having a project that relies on money and profit in order to survive will only end up becoming part of the problem of what is wrong with the world as we know it.

Does that contradict any of my previous positions? Not really. Money is becoming harder to attain for the average person as a result of our crumbling world economy. There's still better and more effective ways of providing value, and being anti-Money doesn't mean we're anti-Value.

Use Linux.
