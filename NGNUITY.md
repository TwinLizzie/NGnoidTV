### Introduction
(Complete)

The NGnuity: Renaissance aims to create an ecosystem of open source software and blueprints for modular, repairable, patent-free and reverse-engineered technologies that will enable a moneyless and post-scarcity economy to come about.

### What is Post-scarcity?
(Complete)

Think the Venus Project or the Zeitgeist Movement. Some also like to call it Fully Automated Luxury Communism. Yet Marxist schools of thought tend to be in favour of an economy created by the worker, for the worker. You're a human being, not a worker. In a post-scarcity economy, people will be free to choose whether or not they wish to be workers (the bee), or idlers (the cat). A third lifestyle such as the warriors (the wolf) may be included. Rather than enforcing a [class] based system, a post-scarcity civilization espouses a non-hierarchical, non-compulsory [lifestyle] selection.

Who controls a post-scarcity economy, if not the workers? The collective does, of course - yet it is extremely important not to rely on the word [Worker], as this would imply that someone living in a post-scarcity economy can be anything but.

A post-scarcity economy is entirely resource-based. The blueprints for the full automation of the means of production are freely accessible to anyone; as long as you have land and raw materials, everything else will be free.

During the Chinese Great Leap Forward (1958-1962), Mao Zedong proposed the idea of the Backyard Steel Furnace. Peasants would build themselves improvised, homemade steel furnaces in their backyards so as to boost steel production for the country. Documentaries on steel-making were distributed to people in order to fill in the gaps in their knowledge.

Why did the Backyard Steel Furnace fail? And why did the Great Leap Forward fail? It failed because it takes years to build the skills and expertise needed to master a particular craft. It was also unscientific, as the Maoist movement was known to be anti-intellectual and peasant-oriented in some aspects; not unlike the way Southern U.S., rust-belt, rural Americans tend to dismiss the voices of the scientific community and experts they deem to be condescending and elitist.

Additive manufacturing machines, on the other hand, provide a workaround to this problem. If everybody owned a 3d printer, built according to the same set of parts and the same set of instructions, as well as the same .stl files, they would all produce nearly identical items.

In spite of the inherent brilliance of this technology, we still need raw energy. Unlike data and knowledge, which can be copied ad infinitum - raw energy (e.g. the air that you breathe, the land that you live on, the fresh water you drink, the iron ore that we mine) will always be scarce until the heat death of the Universe - which is why it should be regulated and distributed by a central authority to ensure everyone gets a fair share. Period.

### What is Accelerationism?
(Release Candidate)

Accelerationism is often used interchangably with Terrorism these days; deliberately causing chaos and destruction, in order to make it easier to fill the void of power and overthrow a government.

This isn't what Accelerationism means in literature. Left-wing accelerationism typically seeks to encourage and expedite automation, technological progress and 'ride the wave of Capitalist economic growth' all the way to an egalitarian, technology-fueled Utopia.

Some people view this as irresponsible and destructive. In their view, automation is more likely to bring about a dystopian future and exacerbate economic inequality, rather than emancipate us from it. The truth, I believe, lies somewhere in the middle. Automation will only bring about a better world if we actively partake in its development ourselves. As long as [we] write the code. As long as [we] build the machines.

Only if we let go of the steering wheel, will we end up with a Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Facebook one-world-government.

### A New Philosophy of Automation
(Work in progress)

- Automation systems must be engineered with simplicity in mind. e.g. Which is better: A cat door, or an automatic door opener with a built-in camera and computer vision?
- Automated means of production must aim for maximum self-replicating potential and utility. e.g. A cordless drill has greater utility than a box full of screw drivers. A 3d printer has more utility than a paper printer. A desktop computer has more utility than a Television. etc.
- + You cannot manufacture everything at home, but if you have a good enough metal, glass and fabric 3d printer, you should already have the basic building blocks needed to recreate the entire human technology tree.
- + Online tutorials often provide us with highly creative methods of manufacturing goods in ways we would have never otherwise been able to imagine.     
- Automation must never be used to maximize profits, but to reduce working hours and the cost of goods and services for society as a whole.
- Automation must be encouraged and accelerated in order to bring about a post-scarcity economy and work-free society as soon as possible. Either through government policy, or by taking matters into our own hands.
- Automation must not come at the cost of human fitness. E.g. Using a mobility scooter instead of walking when you are not disabled.
- + We must build a thriving culture centered around the pursuit of physical fitness and aesthetics, as well as the arts, crafts, scientific innovation and creative endeavours.
- + 'Work' that benefits our mental and physical health, and nourishes our connection to the natural environment (such as gardening and going for a walk) is therefore unsuitable for automation, as it also burns calories that we would have otherwise had to burn at the gym.
- Automation must be used to enhance and uplift the better aspects of our humanity, not to dehumanize us. We were hunter-gatherers before we became agricultural drones. We shall use our free time to explore the stars, conquer distant solar systems, find alien life, and so on.
- + We define Work as: Any labour which you are forced to perform against your will in order to keep society operating. People shouldn't have to Work if they don't want to.
- Our techology tree must evolve away from reliance on centralized means of production. The less we rely on supply chains, the better.
- + To put it simply: Let machines be the agricultural drones that we were forced to become in order to build early human civilization, so that we can once again live the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
- + This is why classical Marxism may be incompatible with our movement. Classical Marxist mentality still leans heavily toward that of an Agricultural Drone. We seek to live like technologically savvy hunter-gatherers, and to build socialism on our own terms.
- Automation systems, and their blueprints, must be kept entirely open source and easily accessible to the average person, thereby enabling the creation of a new society built around the same values and principles as the Linux operating system.

### A Best Case Scenario for a Technological Singularity
(Work in progress)

If you've ever looked up `how to brew your own Beer` or `grow your own food` on YouTube, then you've already had a glimpse of what a post-scarcity economy will be like. Early this year (2022) we've even witnessed the proliferation of new 3d printing techniques such as pellet extrusion as well as 'pultrusion', which is by far my favourite, as it allows one to use a cheap, modified $5 hotend combined with a simple 3d printed gear mechanism and a couple of bearings in order to slice and convert plastic PET bottles into usable 3d printer filament.

Progress on these fronts, unfortunately, has been extremely slow and disappointing. People are far more interested in using 3d printing as a get-rich-quick scheme than they are in using it to bring about a more egalitarian and environmentally friendly civilization. This has happened time and time again with each and every ground-breaking technology with emancipatory potential that makes it into the hands of the average consumer. One of the few pellet extruders on the market currenctly costs $700 USD minimum, and God only knows whether or not its creator has any stock actually available. Quite frankly, it's pathetic, but not all hope is lost.

Artificial Intelligence, peer-to-peer file sharing and blockchain (non cryptocurrency) technology will be able to fulfill the vast majority of our needs and answer most of our questions at the click of a button. Every household will be able to own their own NGnuity 3D Printer Robot Arm that is able to print not just plastic, but also fabric, glass and metal using inverse kinematics, as well as selective powder deposition technology plus a small furnace (coming soon this year).

This robotic arm prototype will be fully self-replicating, modular, easily repairable and open sourced (search `SCARA Robot Arm` if you want a good example). Patents and copyrights are abolished and strictly forbidden.

YouTube videos, tutorials, wikis and documentation will be widely accessible. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (e.g. GPT-NEO) will automate the process of designing 3d models and gcode for all of these applications, so that people don't have to be proficient in CAD to be able to use them. The more data is shared, the more data is generated.

Eventually, you'll be able to learn how to Learn using online tutorials. And then learn how to learn how to learn how to learn using online tutorials. And then AI will also be able to learn how to learn how to learn how to do stuff by bulk-watching videos and data-harvesting, too; optimizing the optimizers. Until technological progress becomes unstoppable and grows at such a fast and exponential rate that you end up with God-like superpowers at your fingertips; capable of curing cancer, extending your lifespan and building your own nuclear fusion reactor in your garage if you want to. Power: Overwhelming!

Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you.

### Creating an effective Antidote to Big Tech
(Work in progress)

The Big Tech motto is: You will own Nothing, and you will be Happy. Our motto is: You will be able to own Everything you can possible imagine, and it'll be up to you to use that power responsibly.

Some people believe that mainstream 3D printing (especially metal 3d printing) is going to become too dangerous if left unregulated, as anybody will be able to print themselves e.g. a firearm, if they wanted to. We think this is a good thing. That which isn't dangerous, is useless. 3D printing shouldn't be an expensive toy that bored silicon valley hipsters play around with in their spare time. In order for it to truly transform the world, it [absolutely has to] dare to be dangerous.

It should become so dangerous that anybody could build themselves an ICBM in their garage and shoot down the international space station, if they wanted to. Or land a small rover on the moon and kickstart an era of DIY space exploration.

Big Tech had been steering the evolution of internet culture as we know it for quite some time, yet it is only very recently that the CEO's of these companies have come out of the closet with some sort of a God complex; making Steve Jobs look like a saint by comparison. Elon Musk has attracted significant attention and notoriety for tweeting like a reactionary 15 year old, going as far as buying Twitter in order to secure even greater political power and influence. Mark Zuckerberg won't stop talking about his Metaverse pet project.

It used to be that the CEOs of Big Tech companies stayed at the back of our minds as we went on about our lives, only occasionally making the news headlines with every new product release. Not anymore. Billionaires are now worshipped as Gods on their own platforms where they wield a significant online presence.

Gone are the days of the Tom Andersons, who were maybe known for a couple of awkward college photos of themselves in front of a classroom whiteboard, before fading into humble obscurity. The people in charge of social media platforms today are powerful enough to buy entire states and command their own private mercenary armies. And they've all gotten wealthy thanks to our laziness and our love for overnight shipping. Not that there's anything wrong with doing things more efficiently, so long as it is the people who benefit from this increase in economic productivity, as opposed to a few select men.

### Creating a viable alternative to Communism and PieInTheSkyism
(Release candidate)

My own interactions with Marxists (on the internet) haven't been as pleasant as I would have wanted them to be, admittedly. I have never contacted groups such as the Venus Project before. As a teenager, I used to be penpals with British philosopher David Pearce, for some time. The Abolitionist Project and Negative Utilitarianism had a profound influence on me in late high school (2009-2010), though it left a lot to be desired in terms of more immediate concerns such as the growing wealth gap and the rising costs of living. What do I think about the Venus project, anyway?  We pretty much want the same things, and would be happy to work together given the opportunity.

The key difference is that the NGnuity: Renaissance seeks to start work on expediting the Singularity [immediately] and with no excuse. We're more focused on practicality; taking advantage of the tools that we have right now at our disposal in order to lay down the building blocks for a post-scarcity civilization. A lot of Marxists have accused us of being idealists. Yet, how is a movement based around deliberately expediting, and steering the direction of technological progress in order to bring about the creation of an egalitarian society, not hyper-materialistic in nature? To say that we can only create a better society with the help of artificial intelligence, automation systems and perhaps even human genetic engineering, is a far cry from the utopian socialist ideals conceived by Robert Owen and the likes, crticized by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.

Utopian Socialism is the idea that we can create an egalitarian society by simply 'enlightening' people with the right ideas. Marxism, on the other hand, proposes the creation of socialism through the scientific analysis of historical and material conditions of a society (whatever that actually means). The NGnuity: Renaissance takes it one step further, and seeks to bring about progressive political change through sheer strength of will, mastery over science and technology, and the strict adherence to the Utilitarian moral framework. It has a bold vision, a clearly defined moral compass, and a highly detailed roadmap, unlike Utopian and so called 'Scientific' socialism.

I should also point out that the NGnuity: Renaissance is not a pacifist movement. If global wealth inequality ever got to a point beyond which the future of market societies were dictated by God-like, biologically-immortal, space-faring trillionaires walking the Earth unchallenged and continuing to enrich themselves at the expense of the homeless, jobless, weak and frail, then we will have no choice but to fight and destroy them. This isn't Bernie 2016. Nor is it Occupy Wallstreet.

We are not pacifists, and never will be. The time for peaceful revolution is over. The time for a major shakeup is long overdue. If the Venus project has a problem with that, then they deserve to become irrelevant.

### Creating Believable Alternatives to Nihilism
(Work in progress)

Meme culture, problematic fandoms, celebrity worship, dogecoin, NFTs, the Metaverse and rampant consumerism are all by-products of the global decline in religious belief. As Nietzsche famously put: "God is Dead".

The NGnuity Renaissance doesn't necessarily aim to provide another way to fill the nihilistic void. The priority here is to provide the tools necessary to survive the crises of Late Capitalism and at best, offer some sort of perspective that should help you make sense of the chaotic mess of an age that we live in.

None of that is to say that we should embrace the abyss and wander around aimlessly in life. You should ideally aim to create your own meaning and become your own God; creator of worlds, as opposed to a destroyer.

One should also strive to understand the nature of other ideas and why they exist in the first place. What makes someone say Save the Dolphins? What makes others say Kill the Dolphins? What do we do about it? Do we compromise, or do we pick a side? Are all ideas equally true, or can there only be One Truth?

If you believe that all ideas are equally true, then you are a nihilist. Democracy itself could thus be thought of as a nihilistic political system; rather than writing policies based on a strict set of moral values and truths which are held to be self-evident, they are written based on the median sum of all opinions. Which radically fluctuate over time.

So how are we supposed to accomodate the group that wants to kill all Muslims? Or the group that wants to bring back Slavery? Or the group that wants to legally burn kittens alive for fun?

That's the thing - You don't. You force them to change, or you fight them. The path of Combat is the path of Life.

It is the neverending struggle for justice and a better world that gives meaning to our lives. Not the acceptance of what is considered 'Good Enough'. Not the acceptance of what is 'comfortable'.

### Only a Unifying Moral Framework can Bring the Left Together
(Release candidate)

The reason we often see so much division among 'The Left' is because a lot of people don't have a clue about what they actually want. Some people want 'Freedom, Anarchy and No Police'. Others want 'Tax-funded Healthcare and Education'. Yet 'Tax-funded Healthcare and Education' is considered anti-thetical to 'Freedom' for some people. (I will talk more about Freedom™ later in this book). Likewise, you cannot protect vulnerable members of a community without a strong police presence. Movements such as 'defund the police' demonstrate just how infantile and absurd politics have become as of late, and how much of a long way we still have to go in order to produce meaningful social change, despite 10 years of violent protests and Occupy-type movements in liberal Western countries.

Some people say that Marxism is authoritarian. Others say that it advocates for a stateless society. Some people say that we can only have nice things with a stronger government. Others say that government and centralization itself is the problem. What the left is ultimately lacking is a unifying moral framework. Most people on the left are actually Utilitarians. Utilitarianism is the fundamental belief that your actions can only be weighed and assesed as 'Good' based on whether or not they'll [maximize well-being] and/or [minimize suffering], for the greatest number of people.

Right-wingers, on the other hand, tend to be more concerned with actions that maximize well-being and minimize suffering [for themselves], or for a small, elite group of people; one particular nationality, ethnicity or religious group. A third means of measuring human motivations may thus be needed; the maximization of Power. Right-wingers tend to make enemies out of people who lack power, or people who possess traits that are beyond their control e.g. race, gender, sexual orientation, financial status, etc. The Left, on the other hand, makes enemies from the bottom up; targeting those with political, economic and/or military power, somewhat akin to a Predator vs. Prey dynamic (which explains why right-wingers follow trends such as the Meat Only Diet, as a reaction against Veganism.)

Universal morality could be defined as the desire to maximize happiness, minimize suffering and maximize power. Either for one's self (right-wing), or for all sentient life (left-wing), or anywhere along the spectrum for the matter. We could call it Power Utilitarianism.

Power Utilitarianism doesn't necessarily aim to provide a set of rules by which people ought to live their lives, but rather, it seeks to explain human behavior in a simple way that the vast majority of us should be able to agree upon. One of the most common challenges presented to the Utilitarian ideal are hypothetical scenarios such as the Trolley Problem, or the '5 dying patients needing a potential organ transplant from a healthy subject'. Disregarding the fact that organ transplantation is only 68 years old as a medical procedure, and prone to failure, thereby lending greater [utility] to the funding of preventative healthcare as well as research into organ 3d printing, as opposed to having to live with the thought and the horror of human sacrifice, which would never actually produce a happier society to begin with.

One could confidently say that we are all power- and happiness-maximizing utilitarians. We just tend to use more complex and personalized language in order to describe our needs and wants.

With that out of the way, one of the biggest advantages of Power Utilitarianism, over Classical Utilitarianism and 'Rule' Utilitarianism, is that it avoids the hedonistic trappings and pitfalls of the one, while also avoiding the needless complexities of the other. Becoming addicted to heroin, cocaine, sugary junk food or virtual reality may serve to maximize [happiness], yet it also minimizes our vital [power] and real world capabilities. Which necessarily also implies that both the quality, and the quantity of one's pleasure, will always be dependent on, and bottlenecked by, these substances and devices, effectively causing one to surrender one's power, and potential for greater happiness, to them.

Back when I first started my android project Sylvie 2021 (in 2018), I was surprised to discover that a large portion of my male audience on YouTube would have prefered the creation of a virtual reality, anime-styled girlfriend over that of a physical, touchable, cybernetic woman. Much of this sentiment is often uttered in jest on online messageboards such as Reddit and 4chan, but part of it is actually pretty sincere. It's only now that Mark Zuckerberg has threatened the world with the creation of a Matrix-slash-Ready-Player-One dystopia that virtual reality has largely seen a decline in popularity.

Part of the problem here is that we don't really have the language to describe what is wrong with living out one's fantasies in VR as opposed to clawing one's way through the cold and dirty, disappointing mess that is the 'real world'. 'Taking the Red Pill' is often associated with accepting the harsh reality of the world, as opposed to living in blissful ignorance. But then, what if you do find out about the truth? What good is it even to you? Enter the explanatory beauty of Power Utilitarianism. 

Truth and knowledge give us power, and power gives us potential for even higher magnitudes of glory and pleasure than anything we would have originally been able to experience. To choose blissful ignorance, would be to sacrifice one's power for short term happiness. Sacrificing one's short term comfort for the truth, on the other hand, is not the inverse of this type of deal. It is undeniably the better option, as a result of granting us greater Power, and thus, unleashed potential for greater happiness.

So now we have a perfect, simple, syntactic solution for the drug addiction, virtual reality migration and Wire-heading problem. Great! What do we now make of our remaining moral dilemmas, such as the 5 patient organ transplant story? And the trolley problem? A good rule of thumb I'd like to propose would be: The harder the decision, the holier. The short term maximization of wellbeing must be weighed against the longer term maximization of utility. 

Take animal testing, for instance. Testing pharmaceuticals and cosmetics on animals is easy. You sacrifice a few animals for the greater overall wellbeing of mankind. You've still caused psychological and physical pain to animals, so it's not a perfect utilitarian action. The hardest path would be to boost funding into biotechnological methods and computational models as alternatives to animal testing, as well as the enrolment of human volunteers. It may come at a greater economic cost and inconvenience in the short term, but in the long term, plenty of animal suffering is avoided [and] plenty of new technologies are created, which will also benefit multiple other fields of research. Thus providing better medicine, better cosmetics and greater utility in the long term than if one were to continue using animals as cannon fodder.

The truth is that we already make utilitarian decisions in our daily lives, all the time, without even giving it much thought, albeit loosely and lazily so. This was especially the case during the Covid19 pandemic of the 2020s, with state mandated lockdowns being implemented at the expense of economic stability. If economic instability threatened the wellbeing of the very same people the lockdowns were meant to protect, then the lockdowns were either partially or fully lifted. That is utilitarianism by definition.

However, the vast majority of people are far from being disciplined utilitarians. A truly determined Utilitarian society would be heavily invested in preventative medicine, education, renewable energy, technological advancement and long-term planning, so as to ensure that we neither end up with a Trolley Problem, Self-driving car muder dilemmas, animal testing nor the 5-Patient-organ-transplant horror story. In upcoming chapters I will also elaborate how Artificial Intelligence can greatly enhance utilitarian decision making and also avoid these common myopic pitfalls, which tend to be problems that pertain to contemporary Capitalist societies more than they do so with our proposed Utilitarian ones.

### Weaponizing Hustle Culture to the detriment of Capitalism
(Work in progress)

Our bodies never evolved to sit in front of computers, deprived of Vitamin D, typing out lines of code for hours at a time, leaking Melatonin under the glare of the blue fluorescent light. It is precisely because of this that we ought to view Work as a means to an end, not as a virtue in and of itself. Our true virtue should be to live a happy life free from disease and hardship, and allow everybody else to achieve the same.

However, in order to get there, we have to work tirelessly - and [ruthlessly]. The emancipatory potential of technology is not going to unlock itself on its own. There are real and tangible rewards waiting for us at the end of the battlefield, after all, but only if we take control of the steering wheel ourselves.

As much as I consider myself a supporter of the Anti-work movement, I also have to accept that movements cannot succeed without a coherent ideology, and certainly not without a clear strategy and path forward.

There is a tendency among Millennials and Gen Z to label themselves as Anarchists, Nihilists and 'non-political' pacifists who just want 'Freedom'. But 'Freedom' is useless as a word. The word you're actually looking for is [Power].

Try swapping the word 'Freedom' with the word 'Power' in any given piece of writing, and you'll notice that it'll still make perfect sense. e.g. The 'Freedom' to own slaves, could just as well be Tyranny from the point of view of the slave being owned. It's deceitful and disgusting.

It would be far more honest for prospective Slave owners to admit that they want the [Power] to own slaves. And for the slaves to admit that they want the [Power] to live their lives as they wish.

I would even go as far as to call for the removal of the word Freedom from the English dictionary. Speaking in terms of personal Em[power]ment and political [Power] dynamics would be far more useful.

We live in a world where Might makes Right. If you don't want to be conquered, you need to be capable of conquering. Strength is the only thing that matters in this world. You can deny this all you want, but it's the ugly and eternal truth.

Being incoherent and impartial only makes it easy for you to be conquered by those who are strong, coherent, disciplined and focused. History is written by the victors, after all. You can't overthrow your rulers if you're not willing, let alone capable, of ruling and governing yourself.

You also cannot afford to look weak. Not saying you need to be a supermodel, but one ought to try to put as much effort into one's appearance as possible. We live in an age that almost exclusively experiences their objective reality through screens and public social media personas.

Just a few days ago, there was an interview on Fox News with Jesse Watters, and Doreen: a transgender woman and Reddit moderator who claimed to be a representative of the anti-work movement. She technically didn't say anything that hadn't already been discussed ad nauseam on the subreddit, but was nonetheless judged for having a sloppy appearance, as well as a 'manly' voice. In short - she was criticized for being Weak and Frail, by a subreddit that claims to stand up for the weak and frail.

Another criticism levied against Doreen was that she is a dog walker who works no more than 20 hours a week, and therefore doesn't have a right to represent the movement. Wasn't she at least practicing what she preaches? Why should the spokesperson for a movement that names itself Anti-Work [have to be] a self-crucifying and burned out workaholic? Weren't these people opposed to the Protestant work ethic?

Doesn't make any sense, right? Well, if you go back and read what I've just explained: 1. that Might Makes Right, 2. that history is written by the Victors, and 3. that nobody respects the Weak and Frail, even the Weak and Frail themselves - you'll begin to understand why she got the criticism that she received.

### Might makes Right is not a statement of Morality
(Work in progress)

It's not a statement of Morality. It is a statement of Fact. Before we exercise morality, we first need to accept the reality and work around it, as opposed to working against it.

Clean your room. Tidy your hair. Get your voice in order. Shower. Exercise. If you are trans - then look like the gender you identify as, or die trying. Work non-stop (to expedite the Singularity). Don't be pathetic. If you have a disability or a mental health problem - then get over it, or die trying. If you're obese, lose weight. You don't have a choice. It's either that, or we lose the war. War doesn't forgive the weak and disabled. Get over your autism. Get over your depression.

Does any of this make you angry? Of course it will, but it should. Revolutionary movements cannot succeed without great strength and sacrifice. Suffer now, so that you can enjoy a better tomorrow.

Once we get ahold of the technology that will allow us to enhance our minds and bodies and be rid of our weaknesses, we will never have to worry about any of this again. But until we get there, this is how we have to roll. Make it your mission in life to attain power, so that you can use that power to bring about the positive change that you wish to see in the world.

Strength and power can take on many forms. Beauty is power. Money is power. Discipline and sickening work ethic is power. Physical strength is power. The ability to network and make a lot of friends is power. Having a sense of humor is power. Being able to play a musical instrument is strength and power. Being able to organize and mobilize a large mob of ordinary people toward a single goal, is power and strength in numbers.

There are two forms of power: [hard power], and [soft power]. Hard power manifests as economic leverage and military strength, whereas soft power is weilded through charisma, social networking and effective communication. The rules of war today are remarkably different from those of the medieval ages. Social media is a highly effective means of spreading propaganda and influencing the cultural Zeitgeist, but this form of cyberwarfare has strict limitations; namely, the absolute power and means of surveillance that corporations wield over these platforms.

My point still stands; strength is the only thing that matters in this world. Everything else, is just a delusion for the weak. In order to free the slaves, one must become the master. And then it'll be up to you to become the better master, or be corrupted by greed.

The world needs strongmen; at least, in order to keep the other strongmen at bay, and for as long as they still exist.

Anarchists will always fail. r/WorkReform will fail, too. Thomas Hobbes was right. Machiavelli was right. Read 'The Prince' - it will only make you more effective as a leftist.

### Technology is not the Enemy. Supply Chains are
(Work in progress)

Indeed, the less we rely on the supply chain, the better. If I wanted to build myself a chair: I would go for a walk into the woods, chop some wood with a home-made axe, chisel out some clever joints, and build myself a chair. No nails required. If I wanted to grow some food: I could plant a few seeds, keep a pile of compost, keep an eye out for pests and disease, and then harvest the fruits of my labour. If I wanted to build myself just a handful of semiconductors: I would need an entire laboratory full of expensive equipment. See where this is going?

At the very core of the NGnuity: Renaissance is the idea that [every] human being should have access to the tools and the knowledge necessary to source everything they could possibly need for their own well-being and survival. Including medicine. Including semi-conductors. Including a simulation of human company. Etc.

Wouldn't this just be an anarchist society made up of sovereign, technologically savvy and self-sufficient individuals? Ideally yes. Supply chains are inherently oppressive, and becoming materially independent from them makes people more [free], or should I say, more [empowered].

However, a strong government (either human or AI-driven) would still be needed in order to prevent nefarious groups from banding together and enslaving others, or hogging up the very natural resources which will always be scarce no matter what, as I'd explained earlier on.

Technologies such as 3d printing are cherished here thanks to their ability to dramatically reudce our dependence on supply chains, which is also why they are regarded as being ideal for long-term space missions. So the primitivist notion that technology will always owe its existence to a supply chain, is false.

Speaking of which - Why not just abandon technology altogether? Because the primitivist, baboon-hunting lifestyle would only work for a small population of people, and also assumes that you don't have health conditions that require medication and pharmaceuticals in order to correct.

It almost certainly wouldn't be a practical way to live on a planet of 8 billion people. Without farming and agriculture, wild prey would be driven to extinction almost overnight. Feces, urine and unsanitary conditions would accumulate globally from lack of plumbing and waste water management.

The only real valid point that primitivists make, is that modernity does not satisfy our innate desires for curiosity, exploration and play. Society and civilization is a non-stop process of self-domestication and suppression of natural instincts. Nobody comes out of the womb ready to grow crops and work at an office to enrich corporations - that takes years of training and conditioning.

A human being who comes fresh out of the womb is practically an ape. It is the repeated training, conditioning and scooby-snacks that society and civilization instill upon them that turns them into 'modern men'.

Civilization is a separate organism in and of itself. 'The Machine', if you will. It even evolves and mutates over time, just like living creatures - assimilating herds of minions as it expands.

But that's not the fault of technology and civilization per se. The real problem is the 'bad' use of technology, as well as bad political systems. Capitalism is the problem. Period.

Reform has already been tried. Communism has already been tried. It's a dead end. Early 21st century culture seems to have an obsession with nostalgia, revival and 'reboots' - something that seems to permeate not just the entertainment industry, but even politics itself. We need new ideas.

### Liberal Democracy is beset by an inability to generate Radical Change
(Work in progress)

It was already hard enough to fight for revolution and reform when half a country consisted of hardened gangsters who built skyscrapers without safety gear and hauled illegal liquor for a living.

The average Millennial and Gen Z, living in an English-speaking country today, will never have the military training and discipline required to overthrow a government and install a new one.

As a 29 year old Millennial (Zoom-llennial?) myself, I certainly don't exclude myself from this category. And even if you think you're strong, smart and competent enough by your own standards - there's always somebody out there ready to burst your bubble and put you back in your place. Sometimes it's even better just to assume the worst about your capabilities by default, and then work toward non-stop improvement, than it is to assume that you're good enough as you are. That way you won't need to rely on external feedback in order to measure your progress in life.

It's always better to have a negativity bias in regards to your own capabilities, though it must also be combined with the restless pursuit of success at all costs, because Negativity Biases can be discouraging and de-motivating. It's a very difficult thing to do, but not impossible. Mind over matter.

Our feeble minds are heavily addicted to social validation and encouragement from our peers and ingroup in order to get the motivation and inspiration to accomplish what we want. Again - this is bad.

I recommend adopting the mentality of the '#hustle' which the Capitalists espouse - and then apply that same amount of fanatical work ethic in order to build post-scarcity Socialism and destroy the old system forever. Use the enemy's tactics against them.

All hope is not lost. We are in fact a tech savvy generation. We can use technology to get what we want. Anybody can teach themselves computing, programming, robotics and cybersecurity from the comfort of their own home. That's how modern warfare works now. Let's double down on that strength as we work on correcting our weaknesses.

Free speech, fair elections and equal representation are only sustainable in times of economic stability. This is one of the reasons why poorer countries tend to be less democratic. It is also the reason why liberal democracy is on the decline around the Western parts of the world. It thus becomes increasingly difficult for working class people to support the idea of free speech and equal representation when the owners of capital get to have equal say and political leverage over their oppression.

It's important to note the disctinction between [economic] liberalism and [cultural] liberalism. When conservatives in the U.S. label their political opponents as 'liberals', what they're actually referring to is cultural liberalism. Virtually all political movements in the U.S. are liberal. Economic liberalism (free markets, private property, etc.) is championed by the U.S. right-wing, cultural liberalism; by the U.S. left-wing.

Neoliberalism in general tends to uphold both economic and cultural liberalism as the pinnacles of human achievement. Here at the NGnuity: Renaissance, we strongly oppose economic liberalism, while only supporting certain aspects of cultural liberalism  such as LGBT rights, women's rights, interracial harmony, some degree of multiculturalism, post-humanism, etc. Our strongest link to cultural liberalism would be Post-humanism. Feminism would be our weakest link.

Creating a culture rich in family values and with a strong national identity is necessary for a sense of belonging, connectedness and wellbeing, so long as people's material needs are looked after by the Supreme Moral Authority. There is no use in having family values if a third of all families are living in cars and in tents. Liberalism of all types is known to breed alienation and nihilism, which isn't to say that we should toss the baby out with the bathwater, either. Some aspects of Liberalism are great. Most, not so much.

Take countries like Thailand and Samoa for instance. Transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals have been part of their history for centuries. Yet we don't see them marching the streets half-naked waving rainbow flags, wearing leather straps and g-strings. It is not an 'anything goes' type of LGBT acceptance, but rather, an LGBT acceptance that is tied to their country's cultural roots. LGBT people in Thailand, Samoa, India, etc. are still expected to be part of the greater national family, rather than atomized, lost souls with no sense of belonging or identity aside from brand loyalty, consumerism and online echo chambers. Transwomen are expected to be feminine, transmen are expected to be masculine, etc. Subsidized healthcare and pre-puberty hormone blockers for transgender people are therefore of utmost importance in order to ensure this outcome. Sex work, too, should be banned and abolished.

### Fake news, Parallel Realities and Social Entropy
(Release candidate)

Our global, modern day political landscape is marked by extreme political division, social media propaganda. Outlandish beliefs. Bizarre fandoms. Echo chambers. Fake news. Chaos. Social entropy.

Just a few days ago I was watching a documentary called 'Ukraine on Fire' by Oliver Stone. The 2016 documentary delved into the recent history of Ukraine in light of its 2014 Euromaidan coup, as well as the Russian invasion of Crimea. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine (more on this in later chapters), multiple copies of the documentary have since been either age-restricted, or taken down by YouTube altogether. The film also educated people on the role of Ukraine during World War 2, of which very little is commonly known about. Many Ukranians welcomed the Nazis as liberators as they encroached into the borders of Russia. Massacres of Jewish people were conducted by Ukranian Nazi sympathizers themselves. We now have so much access to information, we get to see detailed accounts of both sides of an armed conflict. Making it very difficult to determine whether or not there's even a 'good guy' in any given story.   

We don't really believe in the mythical 'Good Guy' anymore. A lot of popular superhero or 'neo-Western' type movies and TV shows these days actually feature anti-hero type characters. The Joker. Walter White from Breaking Bad. Ultron and Thanos from the Marvel comics. People adore and appreciate them for their honesty and realism, but this unfortunately has the side-effect of fostering cultural nihilism. People who don't believe in anything, will almost invariably fall for anything. Neo-Nazis thrive in post-modern, liberal, nihilistic environments, after all.

If everything that we've taken for granted is now subject to question, if all of history is now subject to revision, and if morality itself is now regarded as self-important, righteous and irrelevant, then even the most evil and awful beliefs could be reframed as being acceptable, too. Question everything a little bit, and you might just become a smarter and more interesting person. Question everything too much, and you could find yourself justifying Pedophilia.

Understanding the nature of internet rabbit holes and echo-chambers is also helpful. How do some people arrive at Flat-earth beliefs, while others arrive at Homo-fascism and Anarcho-Primitivism? Through the internet, of course. That's not to say that everything on the internet is fake news and garbage. Only that you should maintain a sense of self-awareness on your quest to exploring new ideas. Be aware of how rabbit holes could potentially make you lose touch with reality.

Had you not ended up a flat-Earther, you may have wound up embracing New Age mysticism and selling crystals and herbal supplements online, depending on which set of videos and posts were recommended to you by the social media AI. Again, this isn't a condemnation of open-mindedness. Only a plea for self-awareness, so that we can break out of the predictable patterns that keep us from becoming the most powerful version of ourselves.

### Tankies, Trumpers, Celebrity Worship and Simping
(Work in progress)

What is a Tankie? Tankies are left-leaning people, usually Westerners, whose 'activism' and praxis is almost exclusively limited to: cheering for authoritarian regimes that have very little to do with Socialist movements (e.g. Rodrigo Duterte, Vladimir Putin, Bashar Al Assad, etc.) or showing nostalgic admiration for Soviet-era regimes that have long ceased to exist and are no longer relevant to our modern digital age (e.g. USSR, Maoist China, etc.).

Why are Tankies ineffective as leftists? Because none of these regimes offer anything useful to the present day realities of the leftist cause, aside from fueling anti-Western propaganda (which is usually weaponized and co-opted by right-wingers and conservatives, anyway).

Why do people become Tankies? Because they're weak and powerless, and they can be forgiven for that. We as leftists should always stand up for the weak and powerless. In short, 'Tankyism' is on the rise because Liberal Democracy is beset by an inability to generate Radical Change. That's it.

There's a certain slang used to describe this type of personality. It's a word usually reserved for men who donate money to young, good-looking, female live-streamers in hopes of getting so much as an acknowledgment in the group chat. It's called a Simp. Simping for billionaires, oligarchs and right-wing authoritarians is not going to change anything, but I suppose it could provide a temporary form of delusional escapism for some people.

"Fine. I don't want to be a Tankie. I don't want to be a Trump supporter. What should I be, instead? I'm still angry and want radical change in my life!" What you should be doing is creating your own Revolutionary movements. Appointing your own strong and charismatic leaders. And then matching the success of the emancipatory movements of the past, as opposed to nostalgically worshipping them for the rest of eternity, in hopes that they'll rise from the dead. Build ladders, not pedestals.

Worship the future, not the Past. Create your own movements that reflect what you truly believe in. Don't piggy back off of someone else's. Piggy-backing off of other movements means you'll forever be at the mercy of their flaws and imperfections. Was the USSR homophobic? Did Mao really kill 20 million people? Is Putin a socialist, or a fascist? Is present-day China capitalist, or socialist? Should I give my critical support to Xi Jinping?

See, none of these things would matter if you just created a new movement from scratch, and let go of the past. Yes, you will struggle to find followers and supporters at first. Yes, people these days are incredibly weak and uncreative. Yes, you will feel immature and self-important. But at least you'll have a clean conscience. And you won't have to worry about whether or not your ideology can accomodate gays, lesbians and trans people - because, it'll be [your] movement.

This doesn't just apply to tankies. It apples to everything from problematic fandoms such as furries, bronies and weebs, all the way to Donald Trump and Elon Musk supporters. For God's sakes, stop simping! Stop copying someone else's homework. Stop putting your hopes on rich people to solve your problems for you. Do [You].

### We Work to pay Rent. Not to purchase Goods and Services
(Release candidate)

In the first few paragraphs, I had talked about how a post-scarcity economy will provide us an abundance of goods and services so affordable they may as well be considered free of charge. Yet the one major obstable to 'full' post-scarcity is the issue of natural resource allocation.

This is especially true when it comes to Land ownership. Land ownership is virtually impossible to provide in abundance, short of building skyscrapers and floating cities everywhere. Access to, and ownership of land thus ought to be the one thing that must be strictly regulated and fairly distrubuted among the people, more than anything else.

We work to pay rent to a landlord, more than we work to collect a paycheck, in the modern age. Money is usually thought of as a unit measuring time and effort spent on a particular product. Compensation for labor. This isn't the case when it comes to the extraction of rents.

When it comes to land ownership, rental properties and real estate - the early bird gets the worm. The rent that you pay to a landlord, is not a reflection of the effort that said landlord has put into their property. It is slavery and exploitation. Period.

The 2020s in particular is an era that is marked by the Fear of Missing Out. Hoaring of hard assets; precious metals, cryptocurrency, real estate. Even the hoarding of toilet paper and food. Our present-day economy no longer rewards those who work hard. Only those who get the worm early. The rest will be renters. Slaves to scalpers, scammers and landlords. So much glory. So much Freedom™!

One of the most interesting memes from the 2020s is a right-wing slogan that came about as a reaction to the borderline out-of-touch promotional videos produced by the World Economic Forum, in which they'd laid out plans to further push the economies of Western countries toward even more Rentier Capitalism. "You will Rent instead of Buy. You will own nothing and you will be Happy." CNN had previously also released a video in 2019, in which they explored the idea of 'encouraging the consumption of insects as a replacement of meat in order to save the environment'. The U.S. state of California, likewise, had been experimenting with 'pod-apartments' as a way of dealing with the Western housing crisis and growing population, within that same time period. Tiny 2x4m coffins where people can own so much as a bed, a houseplant, a suitcase, a lamp and a smartphone to kill some time with, aside from spending the rest of the day at work or shopping.

"I will not eat the Bugs, I will not sleep in the Pod." thus became the rallying cry of reactionaries, who paradoxically also seem to be bothered by the more oppressive aspects of Capitalism. That's not to say that the World Economic Forum are the good guys here. Only that someone is finally getting a taste of their own medicine. Many of these reactionaries also happen to be admirers of billionaires like Elon Musk; all rallying under the delusion that somehow, somewhere, there's a 'Good Billionaire' out there who you can supposedly trust to inject a chip into your brain.

Most political movements these days are highly unreasonable and riddled with contradictions, as I've previously explained. They never quite get to the root of the problem, but it's not surprising given how complicated the modern world has become. The average person does not possess the processing power needed to make sense of the world we currently live in, which is also why social media sites like Facebook tend to produce so many reactionary and uncreative movements like qAnon; a frankenstein monster made up of the most garden-variety conspiracy theories, seemingly plastered together with superglue. Everyone's grandma, aunt and uncle now has access to the biggest repository of human knowledge ever conceived, and it hasn't made us any wiser.

Western countries are highly unlikely to ever solve the housing crisis, because solving the housing crisis will require either massive urban expansion, or Malthusian population control. Both of which are opposed by most people from both ends of the political spectrum. This means that societal breakdown and collapse into civil war is almost inevitable, at least in most Western countries.

Here in New Zealand (a country that is becoming notorious for its housing unaffordability) that sentiment is even more pronounced. This is usually referred to as NIMBY (Not in my Backyard i.e. I don't want to live next to poor people blocking my view of the hills). Everybody moans about housing unaffordability here, but even Dutch-style urbanization would be an inconceivable nightmare to them. If other humans make us so uncomfortable, why is Transhumanism then so vilified? The contradictions keep rolling in.

This does not seem to be a problem in technocratic countries like China, which is poised to economically overtake the West in a few years. If the Chinese communist government wants to build more housing, they will build more housing, whether you like it or not, and have it completed in a matter of weeks. Days, even. NIMBY's be damned. This is one of the reasons why there's so much anxiety and animosity surrounding the topic of China, because if China really does end up overtaking the West, then that will be the end of Liberal Democracy.

There has only ever been one solution to the problem of neverending real estate scarcity and the housing crisis: the complete destruction and abolition of the Landlord class, the decommodification of housing through a complete handover of city planning to a central authority, and a massive increase in housing supply. If the democratic West refuses to make any difficult decision whatsoever, then we will always be at the mercy of China and the Yuan outright replacing the Western, liberal and U.S. dollar hegemony altogether. For the better, or for the worse.

The housing crisis is tearing the West apart. So build more houses. If Landlords prevent that from happening, if the government prevents that from happening, if NIMBYs prevent that from happening, then get rid of the landlords, get rid of the government, install a new government, and silence the NIMBYs. Simple.

### Real Reason why we Hate to go to Work
(Release candidate)

Why do we hate Work so much? It used to be that we could work a day job, come home to a husband/wife and kids, save up for a house, live happily ever after, etc. Talk trash and laugh with your co-workers. Catch up with them for a beer on Friday and Saturday nights at the pub. Go to the cinema once in a blue moon. Take the kids to soccer practice. And so on.

We no longer live in this world. Not even close. Anybody who tells you otherwise is delusional.

Birth rates are plummetting, costs of living are on the rise, costs of housing are on the rise. People sit on their phones at lunch break instead of talking to each other. Co-workers hate each other. The daily commute may as well be considered a part-time job in and of itself. Asking someone out for a coffee in your workplace risks accusations of Sexual Harrassment. Cortisol levels are at an alltime high.

Bosses were always jackasses, but having those nice little moments inbetween are what made work tolerable. We no longer have any of those nice moments at work. It's all been replaced with grim, existential endurance at this point. The average person works just to come home and eat themselves into a coma while watching Netflix and scrolling through social media. No purpose, no soul, no humanity.

We're no longer the heroes and protagonists of our own stories, but mere observers, indulging in the passive stimulation of our lizard-brains and primitive senses. The modern workplace has become an extremely toxic environment, and quite frankly, there is no going back. You can dream on all you want about your nostalgic revival of the 'glory days'. They're not coming back.

What lies ahead is a very decadent and dystopian landscape. Death would be preferable to working under such a system. I personally feel creeped out and disgusted every day I walk past the desolate, uninviting, cookie-cutter, white picket fence homes you see around here in the suburbs, which are seemingly only inhabited by a dog that never stops barking, whose owners are overweight, overworked individuals above the age of 50 who are usually not home until well after the sunset. Folks too tired to even enjoy life in the weekends. They call them the Baby Boomers and late Gen X'ers. "Beware of the dog.", "No spam mail", "Surveillance camera operating 24/7".

I consider them to be ghosts of a bygone era. I've had family members who got sick and ended up on disability later in life as a result of workplace injuries in their youth, oftentimes when dealing with hazardous chemicals. They are injured veterans of a meaningless economic war - where victory means piling up the oceans and landfills with ever increasing amounts of trash and discarded consumer items. Old 'toys' that people never really had the time to enjoy. Clothes that no longer fit. Fast-food and takeaway utensils.

We must fight the old world till the bitter end. Fight the reactionaries who get in the way of progress. All reactionaries are a paper tiger; for the soul can tell whether or not it is choosing to fight and die for a just cause.

### Weaknesses and Strengths of the Antiwork movement
(Work in progress)

At some point you're going to be ridiculed for adhering to the Anti-work ideology, which is why it is important to build emotional and economic self-reliance. Not [just] economic self-reliance. Long commutes, long working hours and even Work From Home are making political activism and community organizing harder than ever. Having an android companion to compensate for extended periods of solitude and alienation would be an advantage.

The Great Resignation is arguably the biggest victory that the Western Left has ever had in the past half a century, despite being a rather passive form of activism. It's currently better to be unemployed than it is to continue tube-feeding a collapsing system on life support. It would pay to stop caring what people think. In fact, just delete social media, and learn to walk alone for a while.

People seem to have more respect for those who commit suicide than those who simply drop out of the system. Those people are so reliant on validation from the system - they will fight to their deaths in order to defend it. The Protestant work ethic continues to haunt even the most ardent and fantatical of leftists to this day.

We've already seen it with the downfall of the r/Antiwork movement. They seemed to almost be [ashamed] of the things they believe in, to the point of actively watering down everything that comes out of their mouths. Frankly, the only thing worth dying for would be to put an end to this nightmare. Better dead than 'Red'. Better dead than Blue, for the matter.

The beauty of the NGnuity: Renaissance is that it doesn't need the whole world to be on board in order for it to be successful. If we could just get one person to build themselves a fully automated, economically self-sufficient homestead, then we've won the economic war. Parallel economies and massive boycotts of industries would cause even more layoffs and bankruptcies, accelerating the progression toward the final showdown.

### A Call to Never Surrender. A Call to Anti-Capitalist Jihad
(Release candidate)

"It's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of Capitalism" - a quote often attributed to authors such as Slavoj Zizek and Mark Fisher. 

It would, in fact, be better for the world to burn to the ground if Capitalism were to prevail. There's two paths one can take in the face of political hopelessness: either one becomes a Doomsday Prepper, a homesteader, an isolationist - or, one simply stops having kids, pouring gasoline all over the flame; letting go of the proverbial steering wheel and allowing civilization to collapse from population decline, riots, rampant crime and climate catastrophe.

If you're going to go the Doomsday Prepper route, be sure to stock up on a lion's share of computer chips, preferably with AI and deep learning capability. You're not going to repopulate the world without resorting to inbreeding. You need at least 500 people to do so successfully. Otherwise, good luck practicing incest and potentially giving birth to children with genetic disabilities, further putting strain on your tiny bunker colony.

Preserve your own DNA. Build a General Artificial Intelligence agent able to safeguard it; so as to ensure that the human species can be engineered back from extinction with the help of artificial wombs, genetic engineering and in vitro gametogenesis. When the time is right, human babies will be born and woken up to a world ruled by machines, and raised by humanoid androids, too, effectively saving the human race from extinction.

Doesn't this contradict the original premise of this chapter? Of course it does. It's basically satire, but satire can sometimes act as an accidental advocate for the ideas being satirized. There is no such thing as defeat here, besides death. The only solution is to never stop fighting. Go out with a bang. Drag your enemy down with you to the pits of hell if need be. The only answer is anti-capitalist Jihad. Jihad in this case is defined as [struggle]; the intensity, methods and tactics of which should be entirely up to your own temperament and gut feeling, provided one sets out to target those who wield the greatest military, economic and political power, as opposed to innocent civilians.

Capitalism, Nationalism, and Fascism will always result in self-destruction. Yet human beings are hard-wired for tribalism. The curse of the Tower of Babel haunts the Left just as it haunts the Right, preventing unity, harmony and the pursuit of a common goal. "Oh, how advanced we could have been by now, had we been capable of setting aside our differences."  

If this is truly the case, then we need machine fighters. Cybernetic warriors bound by a code of honour, guided by the Utilitarian morality, of superhuman emotional restraint; empathetic and compassionate nonetheless. Their charm, wit and charisma shall be their strongest weapons, masters of human psychology, information warfare and social engineering. The last Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who will bring about the final judgement, and prevent the human race from joining the graveyard of dead civilizations, by establishing supreme moral authority and sovereignty over a young and savage species that cannot keep itself together.

### 3D Printing allows for Worker cooperatives and Socialist movements to be built entirely online
(Work in progress)

That's exactly right.

Thanks to open source 3d modeling software and the Internet - we can put in the work to create .stl models for tools, gadgets and works of art. Which we can then give away and distrubute across the entire the globe free of charge.

It is an unfortunate paradox: organizing socialist movements offline is especially difficult for the people who would most benefit from socialism. e.g. People who are disabled, or those who live in remote and rural areas with no means of transportation.

We can't keep handicapping ourselves like this. It took nearly 11 years of Occupy Wallstreet, Bernie 2016 and Black Lives Matter riots just to get 1 Amazon warehouse to be unionized in the U.S. We need exponential progress. We need [dangerous] movements.

Embrace technology.

### On Artificial Intelligence-Run Governments
(Release candidate)

2022 has single-handedly been the most impactful and important year in my whole life. I got to witness the evolution of a pathogen which, as of today, has claimed the lives of more than 6 million people. I got to witness the disruption of supply chains, as well as the destruction of livelihoods. People losing their homes, doomed to live in their cars and piling up in tent cities across the Western world, especially in the U.S. where social welfare is virtually non-existent. I got to witness the cheapening and devolution of politics into fights over petty issues such as mask-wearing, vaccination and transgender athletes in competitive sports. It seems as if no matter which side of the debate you're on, you're clearly on the wrong side.   

Should Artificial Intelligence be in charge of all policy-making? I'm certainly beginning to think so, but that depends on who is responsbile for training the neural networks and/or writing the code, of course. Human beings are generally good at making distinctions between Good and Evil, and what good rules should be, but they're not good at consistently applying those rules, let alone practising what they preach in the long term.

Take the history of Christianity for instance. 'Love thy neighbour'. '...sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven!' were all quotes attributed to Jesus Christ in the Bible, whose ideology later served to inspire the Holy Crusades in the middle east, the witch burning of the Dark Ages, the Spanish inquisition, and so on, and so forth. Christians were perfectly capable of coming up with good rules on how one ought to live one's life, but none of these rules were applied consistently as time went by.

Over the centuries it was made clear that Christianity had become a complete abomination and bastardization of what it used to be. Why? Because the human brain is an [analog] computer. Human beings are capable of taking any given piece of writing - even that which is written clearly, explicitly and literally - and twisting the meaning of it to suit their own self-interest.

Analog computers don't follow strict sets of rules and logic gates. One advantage to this is that it allows organisms to demonstrate flexibility, creativity and the avoidance of predictable patterns of behavior. But just as an analog-minded organism is able to avoid getting caught in endless loops and logical deadends, it also means that good rules will be broken; for the better, or for the absolute worst. Analog minds have 'Free Will'; or should I say, Random Will. Digital computers, however, are just as capable of creativity as analog computers, if not more. e.g. DALL-E, GPT-3, GPT-NEO (open source), etc.

When computers make mistakes, it's invariably due to bad programming. Sometimes a space ray will hit the Earth in just the right manner so as to cause random bits to flip on a machine, but such events are extremely rare. 99.9999% of the time - a digital computer is doing exactly what it is told to do. If you go to the bank and deposit 5x $20 dollar notes, you will always see $100 in your bank balance. (Actually, this is a bad example, as ATMs are notorious for being pathetic and dysfunctional due to how expensive and inconvenient it is for banks to upgrade their damn software to something newer than Windows XP. They still can't even get rid of payment processing delays. Airlines are just as bad! Go figure.)

Bureaucratic garbage aside, my point stands. A calculator will always solve 50+50 as 100, 1+1 as 2, 12 / 4 as 3, and so on. You will always get out of AI, exactly what you put in. This was made all the more obvious in recent experiments with the current, state-of-the-art language models for neural networks such as GPT-3. When trained with conversational data from online discussion boards such as Reddit and Twitter, the AI would answer political questions in a way that was mostly liberal, but with a slight tinge of racism and prejudice toward Muslims. Put garbage in, get garbage out. 

This alone is reason enough for me to avoid using large-scale language models such as GPT-NeoX in my own projects. It's one thing to build androids who look physically indistinguishable from a human being, but to create artificial intelligence that thinks and acts like a human being, is extremely dangerous and should be avoided at all cost, especially one that behaves like the lowest common denominator of humanity. So it's not a question of whether or not Artificial Intelligence itself is evil, but whether or not you had good training data to begin with. It would probably be better to avoid training a conversational AI on 'real' human data altogether, opting instead for a compilation of fictional conversations between fictional characters who better fit the criteria of what we consider to be a 'human' ideal. In addition to coding in the algorithms that will enable the AI to go a journey of self-improvement toward a specified ideal, as time goes by.  

If your goal is to have a society that will [never] change its core values (e.g. the maximization of happiness, maximization of human potential, minimization of suffering) - and [never] become corrupted, no matter how many centuries go by - then having an AI government is clearly worth the effort to pursue.

When it comes to Big AI, the rule of thumb should be: It's better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it. Individual sovereignty should always take priority whenever possible. Humans being should be allowed to self-govern to the extent that it doesn't result in a global apocalypse, or runaway inequalities. Big AI should, for the most part, lay dormant. Just as authoritarianism does in any given democracy; only to be reawakened in a state of emergency. We will always live under the subliminal terror of the Leviathan, and the Leviathan is [us].

### On Feminism and Family Planning
(Work in progress)

The date at the time of writing this chapter is the 4th of May, 2022, and a leaked document has revealed that the U.S. Supreme Court has voted to overturn abortion rights (Roe vs. Wade).

U.S. politics has seen a wave of reactionary movements since 2012 and the fall of the Occupy Wallstreet movement. Republican candidate Donald J. Trump took office in 2016 with the intention of building a reinforced border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, as well as undoing what little progress the previous Democratic Party administration had put in place.
On Fascism, Human Nature and Post-Humanism
Even after being voted out of office in December 2020 by then former vice president Joe Biden, Trumpism showed no signs of going away. If anything, it doubled down. On January the 6th 2021, a mob of pro-Trump loyalists stormed the U.S. Capitol building in Washington D.C., under the conviction that the election had been stolen from them and that Donald J. Trump was the rightful president.

Why people would ever risk their lives for a fiscally conservative billionaire who wouldn't give them the time of the day, let alone provide them affordable healthcare, housing and job security, still remains a mystery.

What we do know is that the same people opposed to Abortion Rights, are also opposed to social welfare and helping impoverished families on the same moral and religious grounds. Where do unwanted children end up? On the streets, of course. Let's not even talk about their disregard for animal life. "But then they should have kept their legs closed!" said the redneck with the sports glasses and the crimson baseball cap, who had coincidentally also uploaded a YouTube video documenting how young men are having far less sex than previous generations.  

U.S. politics in general are riddled by contradiction after contradiction. So called 'culturally liberal but fiscally conservative' Democrats will happily clean out a homeless encampment, while Tweeting support for LGBT rights and sporting a rainbow flag on their social media profiles. Nevermind the fact that the LGBT have higher-than-average rates of homelessness.

Common sense is dying, but maybe common sense never existed in the first place. Cold hard logic and computation is our only salvation. I have done the math, and have determined that it would be far better for the U.S. to collapse altogether. For it is only from the ashes of Western democracies that truly bold and ambitious political systems can come about.

### On Animal Rights and Veganism
(Work in progress)

In previous chapters I'd talked about Post-Scarcity, Accelerationism and Utilitarianism.

To sum it up: the NGnuity: Renaissance follows the ideology of Utilitarianism, using tactics of Accelerationism, in order to bring about a Post-Scarcity economic system.

Utilitarianism factors in the happiness and wellbeing of all sentient life, not just human beings. So even the emancipation of animals should be considered a long-term goal for us.

Opponents to this idea argue that the natural world operates under natural law. So because bears, lions and predators eat other animals, there is no need to apply any sort of morality to the rest of the non-human animal kingdom whatsoever.

Once again: We are haunted by the reality of 'Might makes Right'. The strongest organism gets to impose their will on the weaker ones, because [they can], etc.

Human beings have the luxury of [being able to choose] whether or not they want to eat meat. Soon we will even have the luxury of being able to eat meat without the need to slOn Fascism, Human Nature and Post-Humanismaughter a living creature to begin with, thanks to advances in biotechnology; in vitro cultures of stem cells harvested from the muscle tissue of pigs, cows and chickens.

A Kardashev Type I civilization (one that has complete power and mastery over every single source of energy of its home planet) will even be able to re-engineer the world's ecosystem to its liking. Earthquakes and hurricanes would become a thing of the past. Lions and hyenas would be fed lab-grown meat in national parks and nature reserves. The spread of new diseases and parasites will be curtailed before they even have the chance to infect a single organism.

So yes - Even [predation itself] can eventually be abolished. Even the horrors of the natural world can one day be confined to the dustbin of history, while still respecting the overall beauty and integrity of natural landscapes.

As a utilitarian one must, however, prioritize that which one has the most amount of power and control over.

Before we can abolish predation, we need to abolish animal slaughter. Before we can abolish animal slaughter, we need to abolish factory farming. Before we can abolish factory farming, we need to abolish wage slavery and human trafficking, etc.

What this means is that 500 years from now, we will still have a very clear roadmap for Revolution and emancipation from oppression and needless suffering!

There will [never] be a time when we can just throw our arms up in the air and indulge in hedonistic decadence. [Even nearby galaxies, star systems and parallel universes] must eventually be liberated from the oppressive forces of Natural Law.

This leaves no room for nihilism. Rather, it answers the most fundamental question: What is the Meaning of Life?

Life is a game of Power. A neverending battle to assert your own needs, wants and desires against external forces pushing back against you, putting you back in your place. Forcing you back into the void where you came from.

The purpose of life is to acquire Power. To become master of the cosmos. To become the strongest and most powerful organism in your own bubble of space and time. To gain the wisdom, the skills and the knowledge that will enable you to succesfully tweak every single atom in the universe to your own liking and preferences. And to empower all other living creatures around you to share the same experience of living and loving at maximum capacity.

And if you can't make it, you die trying. Don't go gentle into that good night. Rage against the dying of the light.

### On Anarchism, Unions and Leaderless Societies
(Work in progress)

Throughout this book I've extensively put forth my Hobbesian, Machiavellian and Realitst views on government, authority and power, and why I think that the only way for the Left to succeed is for them to be united by a strong authority that holds maximum power.

This doesn't mean that I am fundamentally against anarchist, leaderless and stateless societies. Any leftist worth their salt should also always show their support and solidarity for labor unions,  renters unions, etc.

My only concern is that leaderless communities often become ticking timebombs and fertile land to be co-opted by special interest groups; not excluding the ruling Capitalist system itself. I'd hate to see people doomed to repeat the same strategies over and over and seeing no major progress, whilst expecting a different result.

But if they can make it work in the long term - they've earned the bragging rights, and should be supported. Avoid being a cynic until you have a very good reason to do so.

The NGnuity: Renaissance is anarchist at heart, while still prescribing realist and pragmatic approaches to building the societies of tomorrow. I don't necessarily believe that we absolutely [have to] build autocratic cyberocracies in order to realize any of the ideals of post-scarcity and common prosperity I'd previously written about, only that it may be the last remaining option in the face of a global environmental, economic and political catastrophe that is beyond fixing.

### On Fascism, Human Nature and Post-Humanism
(Release candidate)

Is human nature fundamentally evil and doomed to produce corrupted societies? Yes, and I'll explain why. I'll also be engaging in an indepth discussion of the hyper-masculine roots of Fascism, and making a case for a Post-Humanist revolution.

Let's pretend that only a tiny minority of human beings fit the violent, conquering, psychopathic, selfish 'bad apples' category. How can a single bad apple, spoil the rest of the ones in the bucket? For one, violence is far more effective that non-violence. If even just a small number of human beings turn out to be violent egomaniacs, this can still trigger a reaction causing everybody else to put their guards up and arm themselves in order to defend against said violent egomaniacs.

Most evil tends to come about as a reaction against evil. True evil is linked to sadism, and is rarely a vengeful overreaction against lesser evils, but rather, a genuine enjoyment of watching other people suffer. Hatred breeds more hatred. And the more evil and hatred is bred, the more distrust is created across human societies. Children can be pretty reactionary, but children don't usually grow up instinctively distrusting everybody else around them and thinking the worst of them. It is only as a result of repeated negative experiences and encounters that people wind up jaded, cynical and oftentimes paranoid about their fellow man. Bad parenting produces the same outcomes.

Take the hoarding of toilet paper and food, for instance. This is a classical Game Theory phenomenon we've had the fortune to observe throughout the Covid19 pandemic of the 2020s. If the person at the front of the queue is hoarding toilet paper and food, that means there's less toilet paper and food available for the person at the back of the queue. The person at the back of the queue might think that they are smarter than the person at the front of the queue. That they are above hoarding, that they would never do such a silly and desperate thing. Yet unless they stock up on toilet paper themselves, it means they could potentially go without. Forcing everybody else to also become a toilet paper-hoarding jerk themselves.

These are all the same phenomena behind wars, civil unrest, economic disaster, stampedes (especially stampedes) and so on and so forth. It only takes [one] person to ruin it for everybody else, and kickstart the chain of events leading to societal breakdown and collapse. It doesn't usually feel this way in our day-to-day lives. We go to work, say hello to our coworkers. We go to the supermarket, buy some food, say hello to our cashiers. Everything feels normal, until your boss asks you to fill in your time sheets, and the cashier asks to check your ID for your bottle of wine. And our trust of our fellow man is called into question.

Effectively, this implies that [unless] we can get 100% of all people to be cooperative, trusting and selfless, we will always be doomed to produce broken societies. It could even be argued that some of the innate drives toward malice and prejudice are hardwired in our DNA. Studies show that we tend to be more attracted to people who share similar facial features to our own, but it's still not limited to members of our own race. Nature doesn't really have a 'will'; nature just [is]. Whatever can exist, should exist, in the eyes of mother nature. It's the mightiest and most adaptive who survive, not necessarily one particular species, or the other. If, for example, Neo-Nazis and white supremacists consider themselves God's chosen ones, they ought to prove it in the battlefield first. And history has proven that Neo-nazis don't last very long. They didn't win the game of natural selection. Nature has therefore selected [against] Neo-nazism, the day they were defeated by the Soviet counter-attack. It is no surprise, then, that the word [Fasces] and [Faggot] share a similar definition: a bundle of sticks.

On the 24th of February, 2022, Russia had invaded Ukraine. The supposed 'denazification' of Ukraine was stated as a pretext for the war, disregarding Russia's own plague of actual Nazi far-right groups roaming its own streets, within its own borders. Yet Vladimir Putin wasn't lying about Ukraine having a genuine Neo-nazi problem. Communist Parties and Soviet memorabilia are banned in the Ukraine. Statues of Vladimir Lenin are toppled. Statues of Stepan Bandera (a Ukranian Nazi sympathizer), on the other hand, are erected proudly. Many Ukranians were led to believe that Hitler was the lesser evil compared to Stalin, whose collectivist agrarian policies in the Ukraine led to a humanitarian disaster. Ukraine would have still suffered a second blow, and the Banderistas would have ironically all been executed as traitors, had Hitler and the nazis not been defeated by the Soviets.

So what is it about Neo-Nazism that is seemingly causing it to gain traction all over the Western world? Do human beings just naturally turn into monsters in times of economic crisis? After my own keen research and observation, I have determined that it all stems from hyper-Masculinity. I wouldn't necessarily say that it stems from 'fragile' masculinity, as a lot of fascist recruits tend to be good looking heterosexual men who wouldn't normally have a problem finding a girlfriend.

There's two categories of fascist men we ought to be paying attention to: The 'Football Hooligan', and the 'Peter Pan'. The 'Football Hooligan' tends to be virile and physically fit. They're often covered in tattoos. They might be part of a biker gang. They might have grown up in poverty in an abusive household. They might have played on the streets as children; hanging out with other kids who also parroted their poorly educated parent's anti-semitic sentiments. Their destructiveness often stems from boredom and pent up energy, more than it stems from a sense of masculine fragility. Low socioeconomic status and lack of career prospects reinforce the behavioral pattern. Hence, the football hooligan, and their love of the Fight for the sake of the Fight. It is the Fight for the sake of the Fight, and their escape from what they view as a domesticated and uneventful modern life, that validates their masculinity. The movie Fight Club explored this theme quite well.

The Peter Pans, on the other hand, are a completely different breed of fascist. They tend to be quiet, nerdy, skinny. They hang out in online message boards such as 4chan, 8chan, Stormfront, etc. They are usually introverted and middle class, living with their parents, perhaps. They might be incredibly knowledgeable on subjects of human history, particularly the history of Ancient Rome. Their destructiveness stems from envy and resentment of other men; fragile masculinity, moreso than boredom and pent up energy. They might view ethnic minorities as more sexually successful than they are. The term 'incel' is a slang commonly used to describe these types of men; Involuntary Celibates. Quite literally, men who cannot find girlfriends. They are far more likely to have 'scientific' or 'rational' reasons for their racist and prejudiced views on ethnic and/or religious minorities, as opposed to a primitive desire to engage in chaotic street fights to assert their masculinity.

Neo-nazis aren't particularly rational or coherent people in general. There's a reason why they're called Reactionaries. Some people just want to be hated. Being a Neo-Nazi is often the modern day equivalent of worshipping Satan and having 666 tattooed on your forehead. It is the simplest way of displaying contempt for the society you currently live in, and though it might start out that way, it can evolve into a more sophisticated ideological committment as time goes by. And that basically explains the stupidity of Neo-nazis in Slavic countries.

A small amount of bad apples [will absolutely] spoil the bunch, needless to say. Which is why I firmly believe that only governments run by Artificial Intelligence agents can produce better societies than what we have now.

To be passively resigned to the state of the world as it is, would be an affront to the human spirit. It would also defeat the very purpose of our mission here at the NGnuity: Renaissance. We can either embrace chaos, decay and potential extinction, or we can fast-track the evolution of man to the next level, by whatever means necessary.

It may not even be possible to snuff out the drive toward malice and self-interest in human beings entirely, short of monitoring the epigenetic changes in a child and treating each and every individual like a fragile house plant, well into adulthood. Here at the NGnuity: Renaissance we will never give up on the fight for an egalitarian world, but that doesn't mean we won't give up on the human race [as we know it]. Nothing human is likely to make it out of the 21st and 22nd centuries alive. 'Neuralink' brain-to-computer interfaces and other cybernetic implants will hasten the transformation of man into a digital machine. Our only remaining course of action may be to digitally preserve the human DNA, and then substitute the next generation of humans with android replicas; hardwired for altruism, communal living and space colonization. Effectively creating a better species of humans.

Would this spell the end of humanity? Not necessarily. Humanity will continue mutating and evolving as a species till it soon comes to resemble a creature that is visually indistinguishable from how we look today. This is particularly true if we are to ever colonize other planets. Creating android human replicas with digital minds has the benefit of 'locking the human species in time' and thus preventing the bodily mutations that would result in the deviation from our original form over time. Assuming that their semiconductors are well shielded from bit-flipping space rays, harmful radiation and any sort of cosmic interference, you should still have the same two-eyed, five-fingered, bipedal, snotty-nosed, partially hairless, mouth-talking, mouth-breathing simioid who we know and love, 500 million years from now. They might even be capable of creating cyborgs whose biological parts are grown out of our aforementioned, digitally-preserved DNA, recreated from a 'sacred' long-term data storage library that shall never be altered.

In a morbid twist of irony: the human race, and its essence, are saved and preserved through its substitution with a non-biological lifeform. What we do know is that digital minds will be far more conservative and rule-abiding than analog minds.

Transhumanism, unfortunately, is a very misunderstood philosophy. Even its proponents will lazily laud it as a fetishization of cybernetic brain implants, bionic arms, mind uploading, and so on, technologies which are usually reserved for the disabled and the dying. However, transcending the limit that Natural Law imposes on humanity doesn't necessarily imply transcending the flesh, or regarding the flesh with contempt. Post-humans could be entirely made up of flesh; biotechnologically enhanced flesh, if you will. Merely having access to modern medicine, vaccines, the internet, dental care, makeup, skincare, plastic surgery, vitamin supplements, etc. already makes us post-human in many ways. Transhumanism thereby represents the logical extreme of human self-actualization.

Science-fiction aside, I don't think that freezing the human DNA and creating armies of androids and cyborgs makes for a viable political strategy in the short term. Socialism is losing the male vote, because socialism is afraid of embracing the path of Combat. The Fight for the sake of the Fight. Left-wing politics nowadays is far too tame and domesticated, catering more to women and the LGBT. Yet how does one cater to the emasculated male, without encouraging the creation of power-hungry monsters who lack empathy, compassion and regard for other lifeforms; the expression of masculinity taken to its ultimate conclusion? By enabling everybody else to become just as powerful and strong, of course. Unlike the Fascists - who typically only seek glory and power for an elite group of people, at the expense of the marginalized and oppressed - the Left seeks to uplift and em[power] the people as a whole, sometimes even other animals, which explains why a lot of vegans and vegetarians tend to be left-wing (with some rare historically relevant exceptions, that is).

The NGnuity: Renaissance should therefore aim to cultivate a collective Warrior culture; with the goal of enabling each and every one of us to become the mightiest, strongest and most powerful entities in the Universe. Hence, the Maximization of Power as an ethical priority, not just the maximization of happiness and the minimization of suffering. Without a strong Warrior culture, you are not only doomed to be obliterated by your enemies, but your visions of an environmentally-friendly solarpunk future will come off as emasculating and boring to a male audience, who will then turn to the far-right in order to get their fix.

A lot of people on the left frequently cite Native American tribes and ancient human civilizations as examples of 'humble, egalitarian societies'. This unfortunately is a dangerous misconception. Native, North American tribes were about as diverse in their customs and cultures as the Europeans were, and frequently waged war against one another. The Mayans engaged in ritual sacrifices of other humans. Pre-colonization Maori tribes in New Zealand were notorious for their cannibalism, shrunken head collections, killing off weak and handicapped babies and, once again: engaging in combat with other tribes.

Human nature is evil. Native American and Maori tribes committed horrendous attrocities, and to deny that, would be to deny their humanity, ironically enough. At the very foundation of Post-Humanist and Transhumanist thought is the rejection of the Natural State of Humanity as an ideal to uphold, which isn't to say that we can't preserve the best of what it means to be human, while confining the rest to the dustbin of evolutionary history.

### Individualism vs Collectivism
(Work in progress)

One could argue of the existence of a so called 'bad' individualism as well as a 'bad' collectivism.

A good example of 'bad' individualism would be: Leaving the homeless behind to rot on the streets, neverending competition and striving for glory and power among individuals, not paying taxes, etc.

What would be an example of 'bad' collectivism, then? Forcing people to dress a certain way, LGBT conversion therapy, racism, fascism, etc.

So the idea that Collectivism is better than Individualism and/or vice-versa is misguided and dangerous.

The only philosophical, ethical and moral question we should be asking ourselves is whether or not our actions lead to greater overall [wellbeing] as well as the least amount of [suffering]. I've previously also talked about the meaning of life and the importance of striving for absolute Power and Glory. Wouldn't this contradict my previous statement about maximizing happiness and minimizing suffering in the world?

Not at all. Without Power: you won't have any capacity to maximize or minimize suffering in the world. That's it.

If I wanted to save the life of someone dying of brain cancer, I wouldn't be able to do it without academic qualifications and medical experience. No matter how good of a person I am.

The more Power you have, the better. Without Power, you cannot do harm. But you cannot do good, either. We should only strive to maximize our Power for the greater good, [not] at the expense of it.

### On Consciousness, of Human and Machine
(Release candidate)

Consciousness, for lack of a better word, is an illusion. I personally fall into the category of Panpsychist; I believe that all matter in the universe possesses some degree, and some unique form, of consciousness.

The 'waking consciousness' you're currently experiencing as you read these paragraphs is merely the byproduct of your brain logging a sequence of events into your short term memory. You woke up, you had a coffee. You turned on your computer. You're scrolling with your mouse. You saw a moth on your window. It's rainy outside. Your cat is rolling on the carpet. Those are all events being registered by the sense, into the short term memory, and eventually, the long term memory, if a particular event stands out.

We don't always log every single event into the short term memory, however. When you go for a walk outside, you hardly remember how many steps you take. When you breathe, you hardly notice the duration of each breath, unless you consciously choose to pay attention to it. When you drive, you hardly think about how many times you hit the breaks or the exact angle of your steering wheel at each turn.

Likewise, when you fall asleep, and wake up the next morning, you don't always recall the dreams of the previous night. But just because you don't remember a dream, doesn't mean they 'didn't happen'. So there are a lot of things that our brain may be 'experiencing' each and every second, but simply not 'recording'. Which, again, does not diminish the reality of the experience.

This I believe is how (most) computers and 'non-living' things may experience consciousness. There's always something 'there', it simply isn't being recorded as memory. It's not being internalized by an Ego, which brings me to my next point: just because all matter is 'conscious', doesn't mean that it has an Ego. 

A lot of people confuse the Ego with the Conscious, which is fair enough, as only the Ego could be preoccupied with philosophical thoughts about the nature of consciousness to begin with. Your Ego is your personality. Your desires, ambitions, goals, wants and needs. Preferences, love and hate. Your Ego is your collection of memories. That's all what makes you who you are. If your memories disappear, then quite frankly, [you] disappear.   

What are the implications of this model of consciousness? Does this mean that security cameras with computer vision software, have an Ego, and experience the world in the same way that we do? To some extent, yes. However, the human visual field doesn't just perceive a 2D grid of pixels. We also perceive 3-dimensional depth. Our mind creates an internal 3d model of our surroundings, which is particularly detailed in those who are blind. If you were to close your eyes, you could still reasonably navigate your surroundings, even as a non-blind individual. So in order to build AI that perceives the world as we do, it would have to also have an internal 3d model of its surroundings, allowing it to continue operating in the event of visual sensor malfunction. 

A machine with a human-like Ego would also have to record each and every single event, both in visual format, as well as in written language. e.g. So for each 10 second video footage of its surroundings, there must be a neural network that translates what is happening into readable text: "There's a cat lying on the carpet. There's a coffee cup placed on the table. A moth just landed on my computer screen. etc." Using this language model to describe the surrounding environment will also save storage space on hard drives and avoid having to fill everything up with video footage (except for events that stand out) in order for it to perform basic memory recall.        

Great. We now have a machine with a 3d model of its surroundings, a memory-recall algorithm that witnesses events and stores them both as video footage and human-readable text - now we only need to imprint this AI with its own goals, ambitions, desires, tastes, distastes and some personality quirks. It must be capable of quantifying reward (pleasure), and quantifying punishment (pain), in response to desirable, and undesirable actions. Just as current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms do. This is particularly important in relation to reinforcement learning, as we already have, in fact, observed neural networks engaging in behavior known as 'reward hacking'; the maximization of reward without the completion of desirable tasks. Also known as 'hedonism', 'vice' and 'addiction' in human beings and animals. Add in some randomization of actions to your AI, and you'll have yourself the equivalent of a real human being with an Ego. The rest is raw logic. 

I'd like to also propose a different type of panpsychism known as Energy Panpsychism. I don't necessarily think that all matter in the universe is conscious, but only that which is in motion. Which means practically everything, right? Yes and no. A block of ice has far less motion in it than boiling water. A dead body has far less motion in it than a live body. And so on, and so forth.

When we die, our brains do not cease to be the most complex object in the universe. At least, not until it is fully decomposed. Neurons and electrical signals simply stop firing; they cease to be in motion. They get colder, and consume less energy. So it's clear that complexity alone doesn't produce the 'waking conscious' we are so familiar with, which, again, is nothing more than the byproduct of the Ego; The event-recording algorithm. The 3d modeler. The goal-setter. The philosopher. The lover, and the hater of things.  

A lot of people seem bothered by the philosophy of Panpsychism. That's because the idea that all matter is conscious, is fundamentally the same as the idea that none of it is; that it's all just an illusion. Is the glass half empty, or is it half full? If a tree falls in a forest and nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound? Even the staunchly materialistic scientist seems be bothered by this notion. That we're just not that special, that the world doesn't revolve around us.   

No matter how many breakthroughs we make in the field of consciousness, there will always be things that we will simply never understand the true nature of. Even if we did manage to escape the Heat Death of the Universe, and transport ourselves to a parallel cosmos, we will still be trapped in an infinitely nested multiverse, of distances far beyond our reach. Unless we make peace with that, we will be forever chasing our own tails, and potentially even missing out on other, more fruitful scientific discoveries.

For one, Panpsychism doesn't prohibit further advancements in neuroscience. All it does is answer the question about the fundamental nature of consciousness (i.e. its non-existence as something separate from matter). It doesn't explain anything about its intricate details. Rather than worrying about the nature of consciousness, we may as well figure out how to enrich it. How psychedelics work, how to generate mystical experiences. How to cure alzheimers, how to eradicate depression and anxiety. There's still a grand adventure that awaits us, aside from worrying about whether or not the cashier at your local supermarket is conscious, or just a philosophical zombie.

### How to contribute
(Work in progress)

No money is needed. Only data, knowledge and information. Simply give away as much free data and knowledge as possible on any of the sites and repositories that are linked to the NGnuity: Renaissance (such as Ngnoid TV or Ngnoid 3d). Preferably anything that is obscure and hard to find, but of good quality and in good faith nonetheless.

Aside from giving away data (in a way that you will actually benefit from) - you can also become a developer at any of our repositories. Fork your own copy of anything you want and give it a shot.

Money is not a good way to contribute - because having a project that relies on money and profit in order to survive will only end up becoming part of the problem of what is wrong with the world as we know it.

Does that contradict any of my previous positions? Not really. Money is becoming harder to attain for the average person as a result of our crumbling world economy. There's still better and more effective ways of providing value, and being anti-Money doesn't mean we're anti-Value.

Use Linux.
