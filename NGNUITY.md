<img width="200" alt="ngnuity icon" src="https://github.com/TwinLizzie/Sylvie-2021/blob/master/images/web_photos/cat_space_symbol.png">

### Introduction

The NGnuity: Renaissance aims to create an ecosystem of open source software and blueprints for modular, repairable, patent-free and reverse-engineered technologies that will enable a moneyless and post-scarcity economy to come about.

### What is Post-scarcity?

Think the Venus Project or the Zeitgeist Movement. Some also like to call it Fully Automated Luxury Communism. Yet Marxist schools of thought tend to be in favour of an exclusively worker-controlled economy, and are thus fundamentally incompatiable with our agenda. You're a human, not a worker. You should be able to do what you want so long as you're not infringing upon anybody else's rights.

A post-scarcity economy is entirely resource-based. The blueprints for the full automation of the means of production are freely accessible to anyone; as long as you have land and raw materials, everything else will be free.

This is unlike real estate and raw energy (e.g. the air that you breathe, the land that you live on, the fresh water you drink) which will always be scarce until the heat death of the Universe - which is why it should be regulated and distributed by a central authority to ensure everyone gets a fair share. Period.

### Our Philosophy for Automation

- The simplest approach to automation is the best approach. e.g. Which is better - A cat door, or an automatic door opener with a built-in camera and computer vision?
- Automation must never be used to maximize profits, but to reduce working hours and the cost of goods and services for society as a whole.
- Automation must be encouraged and accelerated in order to bring about a post-scarcity economy and work-free society as soon as possible. Either through government policy, or by taking matters into our own hands through 3d printing, CNC machinery (Computer Numerical Control) and file sharing i.e. Digital Mutual Aid. Every second that isn't spent making your work as efficient as possible is a second wasted.
- Automation must not come at the cost of human fitness. E.g. Using a mobility scooter instead of walking when you are not disabled. We must build a thriving culture centered around the pursuit of physical fitness and aesthetics, as well as the arts, crafts, scientific innovation and creative endeavours.
- Automation must be used to regain our humanity, not to dehumanize us. We were hunter-gatherers before we became agricultural drones. We shall use our free time to explore the stars, conquer distant solar systems, find alien life, etc.
- We define Work as: Any labour which you are forced to perform against your will in order to keep society operating. People shouldn't have to Work if they don't want to. Period.
- To put it simply: Let machines be the agricultural drones that we were forced to become in order to build early human civilization, so that we can once again become Hunter-gatherers.
- This is why Marxism is incompatible with our movement. Marxists are Agricultural Drones. We seek to live like technologically savvy Hunter Gatherers.

### How a Singularity will actually come about

If you've ever looked up `how to brew your own Beer` or `grow your own food` on YouTube, then you've already had a glimpse of what a post-scarcity economy will be like.

Artificial Intelligence, peer-to-peer file sharing and blockchain (non cryptocurrency) technology will be able to fulfill the vast majority of our needs and answer most of our questions at the click of a button. Every household will be able to own their own NGnuity 3D Printer Robot Arm that is able to print not just plastic, but also fabric, glass and metal using inverse kinematics, as well as selective powder deposition technology plus a small furnace (coming soon this year).

This robotic arm prototype will be fully self-replicating, modular, easily repairable and open sourced (search `SCARA Robot Arm` if you want a good example). Patents and copyrights are abolished and strictly forbidden.

YouTube videos, tutorials, wikis and documentation will be widely accessible. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (e.g. GPT-NEO) will automate the process of designing 3d models and gcode for all of these applications, so that people don't have to be proficient in CAD to be able to use them. The more data is shared, the more data is generated.

Eventually - you'll be able to learn how to Learn using online tutorials. And then learn how to learn how to learn how to learn using online tutorials. And then AI will also be able to learn how to learn how to learn how to do stuff by bulk-watching videos and data-harvesting, too; optimizing the optimizers.

Until technological progress becomes unstoppable and grows at such a fast and exponential rate that you end up with God-like superpowers at your fingertips; capable of curing cancer, extending your lifespan and building your own nuclear fusion reactor in your garage if you want to. Power: Overwhelming!

Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you.

### How do you differentiate yourself from Big Tech?

The Big Tech motto is: You will own Nothing, and you will be Happy. Our motto is: You will be able to own Everything you can possible imagine, and it'll be up to you to use that power responsibly.

Some people believe that mainstream 3D printing (especially metal 3d printing) is going to become too dangerous if left unregulated, as anybody will be able to print themselves e.g. a firearm, if they wanted to.

We think this is a good thing. That which isn't dangerous, is useless. 3D printing shouldn't be an expensive toy that bored silicon valley hipsters play around with in their spare time. In order for it to truly transform the world, it [absolutely has to] dare to be dangerous.

It should become so dangerous that anybody could build themselves an ICBM in their garage and shoot down the international space station, if they wanted to. Or land a small rover on the moon and kickstart an era of DIY space exploration.

### How do you differentiate yourself from other Post-scarcity movements such as the Venus project?

We pretty much want the same things, and would be happy to work together given the opportunity.

The key difference is that the NGnuity: Renaissance seeks to start work on expediting the Singularity [immediately] and with no excuse. We're more focused on practicality; taking advantage of the tools that we have right now at our disposal in order to lay down the building blocks for a post-scarcity civilization.

I should also point out that the NGnuity: Renaissance is not a pacifist movement. If global wealth inequality ever got to a point where we had God-like, biologically-immortal, space-faring trillionaires walking the Earth and continuing to enrich themselves at the expense of the homeless, jobless, weak and frail, then we will have no choice but to fight and destroy them. This isn't Bernie 2016 or Occupy Wallstreet.

We are not pacifists, and never will be. The time for peaceful revolution is long gone. Period. If the Venus project has a problem with that, then they need to go away.

### Why we still need to be Workaholics, not Slackers

We view Work as a means to an end, not as a virtue in and of itself. Our true virtue is to live a happy life free from disease and hardship, and allow everybody else to achieve the same. But in order to get there, we need to work tirelessly - and [ruthlessly] - as none of this technology is going to build itself. There are real and tangible rewards waiting for us at the end of the battlefield, after all.

As much as I consider myself a supporter of the Anti-work movement, I also have to accept that movements cannot succeed without a coherent ideology, and certainly not without a clear strategy and path forward.

There is a tendency among Millennials and Gen Z to label themselves as Anarchists, Nihilists and 'non-political' pacifists who just want 'Freedom'. But 'Freedom' is a loaded term that can mean all too many things, unfortunately. We live in a world where Might makes Right. If you don't want to be conquered, you need to be capable of conquering. Strength is the only thing that matters in this world. You can deny this all you want, but it's the ugly and eternal truth.

Being incoherent and impartial only makes it easy for you to be conquered by those who are strong, coherent, disciplined and focused. History is written by the victors, after all. You can't overthrow your rulers if you're not willing, let alone capable, of ruling and governing yourself.

You also cannot afford to look weak. Not saying you need to be a supermodel, but one ought to try to put as much effort into one's appearance as possible. We live in an age that almost exclusively experiences their objective reality through screens and public social media personas.

Just a few days ago, there was an interview on Fox News with Jesse Watters, and Doreen: a transgender woman and Reddit moderator who claimed to be a representative of the anti-work movement. She technically didn't say anything that hadn't already been discussed ad nauseam on the subreddit, but was nonetheless judged for having a sloppy appearance, as well as a 'manly' voice. In short - she was criticized for being Weak and Frail, by a subreddit that claims to stand up for the weak and frail.

Another criticism levied against Doreen was that she is a dog walker who works no more than 20 hours a week, and therefore doesn't have a right to represent the movement. Wasn't she at least practicing what she preaches? Why should the spokesperson for a movement that names itself Anti-Work [have to be] a self-crucifying and burned out workaholic? Weren't these people opposed to the Protestant work ethic?

Doesn't make any sense, right? Well, if you go back and read what I've just explained: 1. that Might Makes Right, 2. that history is written by the Victors, and 3. that nobody respects the Weak and Frail, even the Weak and Frail themselves - you'll begin to understand why she got the criticism that she received.

### The 21st Century doesn't forgive the Weak. Nor did Human History as we know it

So there you go - Clean your room. Tidy your hair. Get your voice in order. Shower. Exercise. If you are trans - then look like the gender you identify as, or die trying. Work non-stop (to expedite the Singularity). Don't be pathetic. If you have a disability or a mental health problem - then get over it, or die trying. If you're obese, lose weight. You don't have a choice. It's either that, or we lose the war. War doesn't forgive the weak and disabled. Get over your autism. Get over your depression.

Don't blame me for sounding harsh - you brought this narrative onto yourselves. I'm just the Messenger. As Artificial Intelligence ultimately will be.

Once we get ahold of the technology that will allow us to enhance our minds and bodies and be rid of our weaknesses, we will never have to worry about any of this again. But until we get there - this is how we have to roll.

Make it your mission in life to attain power - so that you can use that power to bring about the positive change that you wish to see in the world.

Strength and power can take on many forms. Beauty is power. Money is power. Discipline and sickening work ethic is power. Physical strength is power. The ability to network and make a lot of friends is power. Having a sense of humor is power. Being able to play a musical instrument is strength and power. Being able to organize and mobilize a large mob of ordinary people toward a single goal, is power and strength in numbers.

My point still stands; Strength is the only thing that matters in this world. Everything else, is just a delusion for the Weak. In order to free the Slaves, one must become the Master. And then it'll be up to you to become the Better Master, or be corrupted by greed.

The world needs Strongmen; at least, in order to keep the other Strongmen at bay, and for as long as they still exist.

Anarchists will always fail. r/WorkReform will fail, too.

### Why Technology? Why not work toward Reform? Why not live in the woods and hunt Baboons?

The primitivist, baboon-hunting lifestyle would only work for a small population of people and also assumes that you don't have health conditions that require medication and pharmaceuticals in order to correct.

It almost certainly wouldn't be a practical way to live on a planet of 8 billion people. Without farming and agriculture, wild prey would be driven to extinction almost overnight. Feces, urine and unsanitary conditions would accumulate globally from lack of plumbing and waste water management.

Primitivists are stupid and it's perfectly fine to call them that. They usually reply to the above arguments by making exception after exception, as well as excuses - revealing the holes in their ideology as they babble on.

The only real valid point they have is that modernity does not satisfy our innate desires for curiosity, exploration and play. Society and civilization is a non-stop process of self-domestication and suppression of natural instincts. Nobody comes out of the womb ready to grow crops and work at an office to enrich corporations - that takes years of training and conditioning.

A human being who comes fresh out of the womb is practically an ape. It is the repeated training, conditioning and scooby-snacks that society and civilization instill upon them that turns them into 'modern men'.

Civilization is a separate organism in and of itself. 'The Machine', if you will. It even evolves and mutates over time, just like living creatures - assimilating herds of minions as it expands.

But that's not the fault of technology and civilization per se. The real problem is the 'bad' use of technology, as well as bad political systems. Capitalism is the problem - Period.

Reform has already been tried. Communism has already been tried. It doesn't work. Early 21st century culture seems to have an obsession with nostalgia, revival and 'reboots' - something that seems to permeate not just the entertainment industry, but even politics itself.

Stop it. We need new ideas.

### Millennials and Gen Z are too Weak and undisciplined to succeed at Revolution

It was already hard enough to fight for revolution and reform when half a country consisted of hardened Gangsters who built skyscrapers without safety gear and hauled illegal liquor for a living.

The average Millennial and Gen Z will never have the military training and discipline required to overthrow a government and install a new one.

As a 29 year old Millennial (Zoom-llennial?) myself, I certainly don't exclude myself from this category. And even if you think you're strong, smart and competent enough by your own standards - there's always somebody out there ready to burst your bubble and kick your butt. It's better just to assume that you suck at everything, and then work toward non-stop improvement, than it is to assume that you're good enough as you are. That way you won't need to rely on external feedback in order to measure your progress.

It's always better to have a Negativity Bias in regards to your own capabilities, though it must also be combined with the restless pursuit of success at all costs - because Negativity Biases can be discouraging and de-motivating. It's a very difficult thing to do, but not impossible. Mind over matter.

Our feeble minds are heavily addicted to social validation and encouragement from our peers and ingroup in order to get the motivation and inspiration to accomplish what we want. Again - this is bad.

Just assume that you're a useless sack of ~sh-t~ by default. And then work hard to try to be slightly less of a useless sack of ~sh-t~, every day. And work toward ambitious goals as if you didn't believe that you were actually a useless sack of ~sh-t~. You will suffer, but you're almost guaranteed to succeed this way. As long as you don't burn yourself out to the point of disability.

But like I said - all hope is not lost. We are a tech savvy generation - we can use technology to get what we want. Anybody can teach themselves computing, programming, robotics and cybersecurity from home. That's how modern warfare works now. Let's double down on that strength as we work on correcting our weaknesses.

### Why do you hate 'Work' so much?

It used to be that we could work a day job, come home to a wife and kids, save up for a house, be happy, etc. Talk trash and laugh with your co-workers. Catch up with them for a beer on Friday and Saturday nights at the pub. Go to the cinema once in a blue moon. Take the kids to soccer practice. And so on.

We no longer live in this world. Not even close. Anybody who tells you otherwise is delusional.

Birth rates are plummetting, costs of living keep rising, costs of housing keep rising. People sit on their phones at lunch break instead of talking to each other. Co-workers hate each other. Asking someone out for a coffee in your workplace is now Sexual Harrassment.

Bosses were always jackasses, but having those nice little moments inbetween are what made work Tolerable. We no longer have any of those nice moments at work - it's all just grim, existential Endurance at this point. The average person works just to come home and eat themsevles into a coma while watching Netflix and scrolling social media. No purpose, no soul, no humanity.

The modern workplace has become an extremely toxic environment, and quite frankly, there is no going back. You can dream on all you want about your nostalgic revival of the Glory days. They're not coming back.

### How to contribute

No money is needed. Only data, knowledge and information. Simply give away as much free data and knowledge as possible on any of the sites and repositories that are linked to the NGnuity: Renaissance (such as Ngnoid TV or Ngnoid 3d). Preferably anything that is obscure and hard to find, but of good quality and in good faith nonetheless.

Aside from giving away data (in a way that you will actually benefit from) - you can also become a developer at any of our repositories. Fork your own copy of anything you want and give it a shot.

Money is not a good way to contribute - because having a project that relies on money and profit in order to survive will only end up becoming part of the problem of what is wrong with the world as we know it.

Does that contradict any of my previous positions? Not really. Money is becoming harder to attain for the average person as a result of our crumbling world economy. There's still better and more effective ways of providing value, and being anti-Money doesn't mean we're anti-Value.
