### Introduction

The NGnuity: Renaissance aims to create an ecosystem of open source software and blueprints for modular, repairable, patent-free and reverse-engineered technologies that will enable a moneyless and post-scarcity economy to come about.

### What is Post-scarcity?

Think the Venus Project or the Zeitgeist Movement. Some also like to call it Fully Automated Luxury Communism, in spite of Marxism being an exclusively worker-controlled economy and thus fundamentally incompatiable with our agenda. You're a human, not a worker. You should be able to do what you want so long as you're not infringing upon anybody else's rights.

A post-scarcity economy is entirely resource-based. The blueprints for the full automation of the means of production are freely accessible to anyone; as long as you have land and raw materials, everything else will be free. 

Unlike real estate and raw energy (the air that you breathe) which will always be scarce until the heat death of the Universe - which is why it should be regulated and distributed by a central authority to ensure everyone gets a fair share. Period.

### Our Philosophy for Automation

Explained in 5 sentences:
- The simplest approach to automation is the best approach. e.g. Which is better - A cat door, or an automatic door opener with a built-in camera, able to detect the presence of your cat using computer vision?
- Automation must never be used to maximize profits, but to reduce working hours and the cost of goods and services for society as a whole.
- Automation must be encouraged and accelerated in order to bring about a post-scarcity economy and work-free society as soon as possible. Either through government policy, or by taking matters into our own hands. Every second that isn't spent making your work as efficient as possible is a second wasted.
- Automation must not come at the cost of human fitness. E.g. Using a mobility scooter instead of walking when you are not disabled. We must build a thriving culture centered around the pursuit of physical fitness and aesthetics, as well as the arts, crafts, scientific innovation and creative endeavours.
- We define Work as: Any labour which you are forced to perform against your will in order to keep society operating. People shouldn't have to Work if they don't want to. Period.

### How a Singularity will actually come about

If you've ever looked up `how to brew your own Beer` or `grow your own food` on YouTube, then you've already had a glimpse of what a post-scarcity economy will be like. 

Artificial Intelligence, peer-to-peer file sharing and blockchain technology will be able to fulfill the vast majority of our needs and answer most of our questions at the click of a button. Every household will be able to own their own NGnuity 3D Printer Robot Arm that is able to print not just plastic, but also fabric, glass and metal using inverse kinematics, as well as selective powder deposition technology plus a small furnace (coming soon this year).

These 3d-printing robot arms will be fully self-replicating, modular, easily repairable and open sourced. Patents and copyrights are abolished and strictly forbidden. 

YouTube videos, tutorials, wikis and documentation will be widely accessible. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (e.g. GPT-NEO) will automate the process of designing 3d models and gcode for all of these applications, so that people don't have to be proficient in CAD to be able to use them. The more data is shared, the more data is generated.

Eventually - you'll be able to learn how to Learn using online tutorials. And then learn how to learn how to learn how to learn using online tutorials. And then AI will also be able to learn how to learn how to learn how to do stuff by bulk-watching videos and data-harvesting, too. 

Until technological progress becomes unstoppable and grows at such a fast and exponential rate that you end up with God-like superpowers at your fingertips; capable of curing cancer, extending your lifespan and building your own nuclear fusion reactor in your garage if you want to. Power: Overwhelming!

Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you.

### How do you differentiate yourself from Big Tech?

Well first of all, we're not rich. Not even close to middle class. None of our work is patented or copyrighted. We are not afraid to infringe upon intellectual property rights and give it away for free, either.

No one can own anything that we give away for free - and once the Singularity goes exponential, no single individual will be able to reign it in or have any sort of control over it. Not even us.

However, if Big Tech achieve Superintelligence before we do, then we are practically screwed because they will obviously use it for their own gain.

The Big Tech motto is: You will own Nothing, and you will be Happy. Our motto is: You will be able to own Everything you can possible imagine, and it'll be up to you to use that power responsibly.

### How to contribute

No money is needed. Only data, knowledge and information. Simply give away as much free data and knowledge as possible on any of the sites and repositories that are linked to the NGnuity: Renaissance (such as Ngnoid TV or Ngnoid 3d).

Aside from giving away data (in a way that you will actually benefit from) - you can also become a developer at any of our repositories. Fork your own copy of anything you want and give it a shot.

Money is not a good way to contribute - because having a project that relies on money and profit in order to survive will only end up becoming part of the problem of what is wrong with the world as the know it.
